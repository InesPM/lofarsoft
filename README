>>> Organization of the code

Once the check-out is completed, you will find the following directory structure
on your disk:

  lofarsoft
  |-- data
  |-- doc
  |-- release
  |-- build
  |-- devel_common
  |   |-- cmake
  |   |-- scripts
  |   `-- templates
  |-- external
  |   |-- cfitsio
  |   |-- casacore
  |   |-- hdf5
  |   |-- plplot
  |   |-- swig
  |   `-- wcslib
  `-- src
      |-- contrib
      |-- CR-Tools
      |-- DAL
      |-- LASA
      |-- pipeline
      |-- pybdsm
      `-- RM

In this:

 - lofarsoft    : Root of the User Software code tree - go there if you want to
                  synchronize your local working version against the repository.
 - build        : Directory used for building individual packages in the code
                  distribution; using a separate directory for this purpose makes
                  it easy to simply erase all compile and link attempts and start
                  again from a clean plate.
 - devel_common : Directory holding common tools for development; this includes 
                  e.g. the find scripts for CMake or file templates for creating
                  new C++ classes. Unless you consider collaborating on the
		  framework, you will not need to touch this (but you will need
                  it).
 - doc          : Local version of the Doxygen-based source code documentation.
 - external     : Hosts the various external 3rd-party packages which will be
                  required to build parts of the LOFAR User Software.
 - src          : Contains the source code of the various projects andpackages
                  developed and written within the framework of the LUS.

>>> Build high-level packages

High-level build targets are available for a number of packages, which are build
on top of other external components:

  * [cr] CR-Tools
  * [dal] Data Access Library
  * [rm] Rotation Measure Synthesis 

Once completing the check-out of the source code from the LUS repository, the
following steps are required:

  cd $LOFARSOFT/build
  ./bootstrap
  make <package>

So in order to e.g. build the DAL, run

  make dal

from within the "build" directory.

_________________________________________________________________________________
>>> Create Doxygen documentation

Create a local version of the documentation:

  ./bootstrap
  make doc

Point your web browser to

  $LOFARSOFT/doc/html/index.html

in order to read the documentation generated by Doxygen.
