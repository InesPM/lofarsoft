  <title>Notes for each Operating System that We Support</title>
  
  <para>
  The purpose of this Chapter is to present notes for each operating system
  that we support. Currently, those are all operating systems supported by
  CMake (all forms of Unix including Linux and Mac OS X, and all forms of
  Windows including MinGW, MinGW/MSYS, Cygwin, and essentially all Windows
  variants directly supported by Microsoft) as well as the DJGPP operating
  system (supported by an independent build system since CMake is not
  available for DJGPP).

    <title>Linux/Unix Configure, Build, and Installation</title>
    <para>
    Here is the short story:
<programlisting>
# Note many other cmake options are available besides -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
# Inspect CMakeCache.txt after a preliminary cmake run to see an annotated
# list of the available options.  Then remove CMakeCache.txt and try again.
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=&lt;install-prefix&gt; \
&lt;path-to-source-tree&gt; &gt;&amp; cmake.out
make &gt;&amp; make.out
#(optional, requires -DBUILD_TEST=ON option for cmake)
ctest &gt;&amp; ctest.out
make install &gt;&amp; make_install.out
cd &lt;install-prefix&gt;/share/plplot&lt;version&gt;/examples/
make &gt;&amp; make_examples.out
./plplot-test.sh &gt;&amp; plplot-test.sh.out
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    The longer (CMake) story is currently documented <ulink
    url="http://www.miscdebris.net/plplot_wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#Building_PLplot_with_our_new_CBS">here</ulink>.
    The eventual plan is to incorporate that material in this documentation,
    but we haven't done it yet so this section NEEDS DOCUMENTATION.
    </para>

    </sect2>
    <sect2> 
    <title>Linux/Unix Building of C Programmes that Use the 
    Installed PLplot Libraries</title> 
    
    <para> This is incomplete.  For now follow what is done to build
    our installed examples (see "make &gt;&amp; make_examples.out above) using
    pkg-config.  NEEDS DOCUMENTATION.
    </para>

    <title>DJGPP Notes</title>
    <sect2>
    <title>DJGPP Configure and Build</title>
    <para>
    Since DJGPP is not supported by CMake it has an independent build system
    which is documented at sys/dos/djgpp/readme.  The eventual plan is to
    incorporate that material into this documentation, 
    but we haven't done it yet so this section NEEDS DOCUMENTATION.
