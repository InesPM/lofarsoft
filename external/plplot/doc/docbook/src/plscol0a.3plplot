.SH NAME
\fBplscol0a\fP -  Set a given color from color map0 by 8 bit RGB value and double alpha value. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplscol0\fP(\fIicol0\fP, \fIr\fP, \fIg\fP, \fIb\fP, \fIa\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set a given color by 8-bit RGB value and double alpha value for color  map0 (see the PLplot documentation).  Overwrites the previous color value  for the given index and, thus, does not result in any additional allocation  of space for colors. 
.P
This function is used in example 30. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIicol0\fP (PLINT, input) 
Color index.  Must be less than the maximum number of colors (which is set by default, by \fBplscmap0n\fP(3plplot), or even by \fBplscmap0\fP(3plplot)). 
.TP
\fIr\fP (PLINT, input) 
Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the degree of red in the color. 
.TP
\fIg\fP (PLINT, input) 
Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the degree of green in the color. 
.TP
\fIb\fP (PLINT, input) 
Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the degree of blue in the color. 
.TP
\fIa\fP (PLFLT, input) 
double value (0.0-1.0) representing the alpha value of the color.
