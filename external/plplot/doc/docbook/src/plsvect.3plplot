.SH NAME
\fBplsvect\fP - Set arrow style for vector plots 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsvect\fP(\fIarrowx\fP, \fIarrowy\fP, \fInpts\fP, \fIfill\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set the style for the arrow used by \fBplvect\fP(3plplot) to plot vectors. 
.P
Redacted form: \fBplsvect(arrowx, arrowy, fill)\fP
.P
This function is used in example 22. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIarrowx, arrowy\fP (PLFLT *,input) 
Pointers to a pair of arrays containing the x and y points which make up the arrow. The arrow is plotted by joining these points to form a polygon. The scaling assumes that the x and y points in the arrow lie in the range -0.5 <= x,y <= 0.5. 
.TP
\fInpts\fP (PLINT,input) 
Number of points in the arrays \fIarrowx\fP and \fIarrowy\fP. 
.TP
\fIfill\fP (PLBOOL,input) 
If \fIfill\fP is true then the arrow is closed, if \fIfill\fP is false then the arrow is open.
