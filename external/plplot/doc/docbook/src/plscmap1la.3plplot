.SH NAME
\fBplscmap1la\fP - Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplscmap1l\fP(\fIitype\fP, \fInpts\fP, \fIpos\fP, \fIcoord1\fP, \fIcoord2\fP, \fIcoord3\fP, \fIcoord4\fP, \fIrev\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
This the alpha value supporting version of plscmap1l. It sets color  map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship between position in the  color map (from 0 to 1) and position in HLS or RGB color space  (see the PLplot documentation) with alpha value (0.0 - 1.0). It may be  called at any time. 
.P
This function is used in example 30. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIitype\fP (PLBOOL, input) 
true: RGB, false: HLS. 
.TP
\fInpts\fP (PLINT, input) 
number of control points 
.TP
\fIpos\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
position for each control point (between 0.0 and 1.0, in ascending order) 
.TP
\fIcoord1\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
first coordinate (H or R) for each control point 
.TP
\fIcoord2\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
second coordinate (L or G) for each control point 
.TP
\fIcoord3\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
third coordinate (S or B) for each control point 
.TP
\fIcoord4\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
fourth coordinate, the alpha value for each control point 
.TP
\fIrev\fP (PLBOOL: *, input) 
reverse flag for each control point. (rev[i] refers to the interpolation interval between the i and i + 1 control points).
