.SH NAME
\fBplmap\fP - Plot continental outline in world coordinates. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplmap\fP(\fImapform\fP, \fItype\fP, \fIminlong\fP, \fImaxlong\fP, \fIminlat\fP, \fImaxlat\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Plots continental outlines in world coordinates. examples/c/x19c demonstrates how to use this  function to create different projections. 
.P
Redacted form:  General: \fBplmap(mapform, type, minlong, maxlong, minlat, maxlat)\fP
F95, Java, Perl/PDL, Python: Not implemented? 

.P
This function is used in example 19. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fImapform\fP (void (*) (PLINT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *), input) 
A user supplied function to transform the coordinate  longitudes and latitudes to a plot coordinate system.   By using this transform, we can change from a longitude,  latitude coordinate to a polar stereographic project, for  example.  Initially, x[0]..[n-1] are the longitudes and y[0]..y[n-1]  are the corresponding latitudes.  After the call to mapform(), x[]  and y[] should be replaced by the corresponding plot coordinates.   If no transform is desired, mapform can be replaced by NULL. 
.TP
\fItype\fP (char *, input) 
type is a character string. The value of this parameter determines the type of background. The possible values are: "globe" -- continental outlines 
"usa" -- USA and state boundaries 
"cglobe" -- continental outlines and countries 
"usaglobe" -- USA, state boundaries and continental outlines 

.TP
\fIminlong\fP (PLFLT, input) 
The value of the longitude on the left side of the plot.  The value of minlong must be less than the value of maxlong, and the  quantity maxlong-minlong must be less than or equal to 360. 
.TP
\fImaxlong\fP (PLFLT, input) 
The value of the longitude on the right side of the plot. 
.TP
\fIminlat\fP (PLFLT, input) 
The minimum latitude to be plotted on the background.   One can always use -90.0 as the boundary outside the plot window  will be automatically eliminated.  However, the program will be  faster if one can reduce the size of the background plotted. 
.TP
\fImaxlat\fP (PLFLT, input) 
The maximum latitudes to be plotted on the background.   One can always use 90.0 as the boundary outside the plot window  will be automatically eliminated.
