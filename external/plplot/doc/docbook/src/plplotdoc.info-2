17.11 plcol0: Set color, map0
=============================

     plcol0 (color);

   Sets the color for color map0 (see *Note Color Map0: Color Map0.).

`color'  (`PLINT', input)

`col1'  (`PLFLT', input)
     This value must be in the range from 0. to 1. and is mapped to
     color using the continuous map1 color palette which by default
     ranges from blue to the background color to red. The map1 palette
     can also be straightforwardly changed by the user with `plscmap1'
     (*note plscmap1; Set color map1 colors using 8-bit RGB values::)
     or `plscmap1l' (*note plscmap1l; Set color map1 colors using a
     piece-wise linear relationship::).

17.13 plcont: Contour plot
==========================

     plcont (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel, pltr,
     pltr_data);

   Draws a contour plot of the data in ``z'[`nx'][`ny']', using the
``nlevel'' contour levels specified by ``clevel''.  Only the region of
the array from ``kx'' to ``lx'' and from ``ky'' to ``ly'' is plotted
out. A transformation routine pointed to by ``pltr'' with a pointer
``pltr_data'' for additional data required by the transformation routine
is used to map indices within the array to the world coordinates. See
the following discussion of the arguments and *Note Contour and Shade
Plots: Contour and Shade Plots. for more information.

`z'  (`PLFLT **', input)
     Pointer to a vectored two-dimensional array containing data to be
     contoured.

`nx, ny'  (`PLINT', input)
     Physical dimensions of array ``z''.

`kx, lx'  (`PLINT', input)
     Range of `x' indices to consider.

`ky, ly'  (`PLINT', input)
     Range of `y' indices to consider.

`clevel'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array specifying levels at which to draw contours.

`nlevel'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of contour levels to draw.

`pltr'  (`void (*) (PLFLT, PLFLT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *, PLPointer)  ', input)
     Pointer to function that defines transformation between indices in
     array ``z'' and the world coordinates (C only). Transformation
     functions are provided in the PLplot library: `pltr0' (*note
     pltr0; Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::) for
     identity mapping, and `pltr1' (*note pltr1; Linear interpolation
     for grid to world mapping using singly dimensioned coord arrays::)
     and `pltr2' (*note pltr2; Linear interpolation for grid to world
     mapping using doubly dimensioned coord arrays [column dominant; as
     per normal C 2d arrays]::) for arbitrary mappings respectively
     defined by one- and two-dimensional arrays. In addition,
     user-supplied routines for the transformation can be used as well.
     Examples of all of these approaches are given in *Note Contour
     Plots from C: Contour Plots from C..  The transformation function
     should have the form given by any of `pltr0' (*note pltr0;
     Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::), `pltr1'
     (*note pltr1; Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using
     singly dimensioned coord arrays::), or `pltr2' (*note pltr2;
     Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using doubly
     dimensioned coord arrays [column dominant; as per normal C 2d
     arrays]::).

`pltr_data'  (`PLPointer', input)
     Extra parameter to help pass information to `pltr0' (*note pltr0;
     Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::), `pltr1'
     (*note pltr1; Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using
     singly dimensioned coord arrays::), `pltr2' (*note pltr2; Linear
     interpolation for grid to world mapping using doubly dimensioned
     coord arrays [column dominant; as per normal C 2d arrays]::), or
     whatever routine that is externally supplied.

17.14 plcpstrm: Copy state parameters from the reference stream to the current stream
=====================================================================================

     plcpstrm (iplsr, flags);

   Copies state parameters from the reference stream to the current
stream.  Tell driver interface to map device coordinates unless
``flags' == 1'.

   This function is used for making save files of selected plots (e.g.
from the TK driver). After initializing, you can get a copy of the
current plot to the specified device by switching to this stream and
issuing a `plcpstrm' (*note plcpstrm; Copy state parameters from the
reference stream to the current stream::) and a `plreplot' (*note
plreplot; Replays contents of plot buffer to current device/file::),
with calls to `plbop' (*note plbop; Begin a new page::) and `pleop'
(*note pleop; Eject current page::) as appropriate. The plot buffer
must have previously been enabled (done automatically by some display
drivers, such as X).

`iplsr'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of reference stream.

`flags'  (`PLBOOL', input)
     If ``flags'' is set to true the device coordinates are not copied
     from the reference to current stream.

17.42 plgriddata: Grid data from irregularly sampled  data
==========================================================

     plggriddata (x, y, z, npts, xg, nptsx, yg, nptsy, zg, type, data);

   Real world data is frequently irregularly sampled, but all PLplot 3D
plots require data placed in a uniform grid. This function takes
irregularly sampled data from three input arrays `x[npts]', `y[npts]',
and `z[npts]', reads the desired grid location from input arrays
`xg[nptsx]' and `yg[nptsy]', and returns the gridded data into output
array `zg[nptsx][nptsy]'. The algorithm used to grid the data is
specified with the argument `type' which can have one parameter
specified in argument `data'.

`x'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     The input `x' array.

`y'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     The input `y' array.

`z'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     The input `z' array. Each triple `x[i]', `y[i]', `z[i]' represents
     one data sample coordinate.

`npts'  (`PLINT', input)
     The number of data samples in the `x', `y' and `z' arrays.

`xg'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     The input array that specifies the grid spacing in the x
     direction. Usually `xg' has `nptsx' equally spaced values from the
     mininum to the maximum values of the `x' input array.

`nptsx'  (`PLINT', input)
     The number of points in the `xg' array.

`yg'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     The input array that specifies the grid spacing in the y
     direction. Similar to the `xg' parameter.

`nptsy'  (`PLINT', input)
     The number of points in the `yg' array.

`zg'  (`PLFLT **', output)
     The output array, where data lies in the regular grid specified by
     `xg' and `yg.' the `zg' array must exist or be allocated by the
     user prior to the call, and must have dimension `zg[nptsx][nptsy]'.

`type'  (`PLINT', input)
     The type of gridding algorithm to use, which can be:

        * `GRID_CSA': Bivariate Cubic Spline approximation

        * `GRID_DTLI': Delaunay Triangulation Linear Interpolation

        * `GRID_NNI': Natural Neighbors Interpolation

        * `GRID_NNIDW': Nearest Neighbors Inverse Distance Weighted

        * `GRID_NNLI': Nearest Neighbors Linear Interpolation

        * `GRID_NNAIDW': Nearest Neighbors Around Inverse Distance
          Weighted

     For details of the algorithms read the source file `plgridd.c'.

`data'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Some gridding algorithms require extra data, which can be
     specified through this argument. Currently, for algorithm:

        * `GRID_NNIDW', `data' specifies the number of neighbors to
          use, the lower the value, the noisier (more local) the
          approximation is.

        * `GRID_NNLI', `data' specifies what a thin triangle is, in the
          range [1. .. 2.]. High values enable the usage of very thin
          triangles for interpolation, possibly resulting in error in
          the approximation.

        * `GRID_NNI', only weights greater than `data' will be
          accepted. If 0, all weights will be accepted.

17.51 plhist: Plot a histogram from unbinned data
=================================================

     plhist (n, data, datmin, datmax, nbin, opt);

   Plots a histogram from ``n'' data points stored in the array
``data''. This routine bins the data into ``nbin'' bins equally spaced
between ``datmin'' and ``datmax'', and calls `plbin' (*note plbin; Plot
a histogram from binned data::) to draw the resulting histogram.
Parameter ``opt'' allows, among other things, the histogram either to
be plotted in an existing window or causes `plhist' (*note plhist; Plot
a histogram from unbinned data::) to call `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up
standard window and draw box::) with suitable limits before plotting
the histogram.

`n'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of data points.

`data'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array with values of the ``n'' data points.

     Right-hand edge of highest-valued bin.

`nbin'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of (equal-sized) bins into which to divide the interval
     ``xmin'' to ``xmax''.

`opt'  (`PLINT', input)
     Is a combination of several flags:

        * ``opt'=PL_HIST_DEFAULT': The axes are automatically rescaled
          to fit the histogram data, the outer bins are expanded to
          fill up the entire x-axis, data outside the given extremes
          are assigned to the outer bins and bins of zero height are
          simply drawn.

        * ``opt'=PL_HIST_NOSCALING|...': The existing axes are not
          rescaled to fit the histogram data, without this flag,
          `plenv' (*note plenv; Set up standard window and draw box::)
          is called to set the world coordinates.

        * ``opt'=PL_HIST_IGNORE_OUTLIERS|...': Data outside the given
          extremes are not taken into account.  This option should
          probably be combined with ``opt'=PL_HIST_NOEXPAND|...', so as
          to properly present the data.

        * ``opt'=PL_HIST_NOEXPAND|...': The outer bins are drawn with
          equal size as the ones inside.

        * ``opt'=PL_HIST_NOEMPTY|...': Bins with zero height are not
          drawn (there is a gap for such bins).

===========================================================

     plmap (mapform, type, minlong, maxlong, minlat, maxlat);

   Plots continental outlines in world coordinates.  examples/c/x19c
demonstrates how to use this function to create different projections.

`mapform'  (`void (*) (PLINT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *)', input)
     A user supplied function to transform the coordinate longitudes
     and latitudes to a plot coordinate system.  By using this
     transform, we can change from a longitude, latitude coordinate to
     a polar stereographic project, for example. Initially, x[0]..[n-1]
     are the longitudes and y[0]..y[n-1] are the corresponding
     latitudes. After the call to mapform(), x[] and y[] should be
     replaced by the corresponding plot coordinates.  If no transform
     is desired, mapform can be replaced by NULL.

`type'  (`char *', input)
     type is a character string. The value of this parameter determines
     the type of background. The possible values are:

        * `"globe"' - continental outlines

        * `"usa"' - USA and state boundaries

        * `"cglobe"' - continental outlines and countries

        * `"usaglobe"' - USA, state boundaries and continental outlines

`minlong'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The value of the longitude on the left side of the plot.  The
     value of minlong must be less than the value of maxlong, and the
     quantity maxlong-minlong must be less than or equal to 360.

`maxlong'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The value of the longitude on the right side of the plot.

`minlat'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The minimum latitude to be plotted on the background.  One can
     always use -90.0 as the boundary outside the plot window will be
     automatically eliminated. However, the program will be faster if
     one can reduce the size of the background plotted.

`maxlat'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The maximum latitudes to be plotted on the background.  One can
     always use 90.0 as the boundary outside the plot window will be
     automatically eliminated.

`mapform'  (`void (*) (PLINT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *)', input)
     A user supplied function to transform the coordinate longitudes
     and latitudes to a plot coordinate system.  By using this

     is desired, mapform can be replaced by NULL.

`dlong'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The interval in degrees at which the longitude lines are to be
     plotted.

`dlat'  (`PLFLT', input)
     The interval in degrees at which the latitude lines are to be
     plotted.

===============================

     plmesh (x, y, z, nx, ny, opt);

   Plots a surface mesh within the environment set up by `plw3d' (*note
plw3d; Set up window for 3-d plotting::). The surface is defined by the
two-dimensional array ``z'[`nx'][`ny']', the point ``z'[i][j]' being the
value of the function at `(`x'[i], `y'[j])'. Note that the points in
arrays ``x'' and ``y'' do not need to be equally spaced, but must be

     plmkstrm (p_strm);

   Creates a new stream and makes it the default. Differs from using
`plsstrm' (*note plsstrm; Set current output stream::), in that a free
stream number is found, and returned.  Unfortunately, I have to start
at stream 1 and work upward, since stream 0 is preallocated. One of the
big flaws in the PLplot API is that no initial, library-opening call is
required. So stream 0 must be preallocated, and there is no simple way

     plmtex (side, disp, pos, just, text);

   Writes text at a specified position relative to the viewport
boundaries. Text may be written inside or outside the viewport, but is
clipped at the subpage boundaries. The reference point of a string lies
along a line passing through the string at half the height of a capital
letter. The position of the reference point along this line is
determined by ``just'', and the position of the reference point
relative to the viewport is set by ``disp'' and ``pos''.

`side'  (`const char *', input)
     Specifies the side of the viewport along which the text is to be
     written. The string must be one of:

        * `b': Bottom of viewport, text written parallel to edge.

        * `bv': Bottom of viewport, text written at right angles to
          edge.

        * `l': Left of viewport, text written parallel to edge.

        * `lv': Left of viewport, text written at right angles to edge.

        * `r': Right of viewport, text written parallel to edge.

        * `rv': Right of viewport, text written at right angles to edge.

        * `t': Top of viewport, text written parallel to edge.

        * `tv': Top of viewport, text written at right angles to edge.

`disp'  (`PLFLT', input)

     Position of the reference point of string along the specified
     edge, expressed as a fraction of the length of the edge.

`just'  (`PLFLT', input)

along a line passing through the string at half the height of a capital
letter. The position of the reference point along this line is
determined by ``just'', and the position of the reference point
relative to the viewport is set by ``disp'' and ``pos''.

`side'  (`const char *', input)
     Specifies the side of the viewport along which the text is to be
     written. The string should contain one or more of the following

17.67 plot3d: Plot 3-d surface plot
===================================

     plot3d (x, y, z, nx, ny, opt, side);

   Plots a three dimensional surface plot within the environment set up
by `plw3d' (*note plw3d; Set up window for 3-d plotting::). The surface
is defined by the two-dimensional array ``z'[`nx'][`ny']', the point
``z'[i][j]' being the value of the function at `(`x'[i], `y'[j])'. Note
that the points in arrays ``x'' and ``y'' do not need to be equally
spaced, but must be stored in ascending order. The parameter ``opt''
controls the way in which the surface is displayed. For further details
see *Note Three Dimensional Surface Plots: Three Dimensional Surface
Plots..  The only difference between `plmesh' (*note plmesh; Plot
surface mesh::) and `plot3d' (*note plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot::) is
that `plmesh' (*note plmesh; Plot surface mesh::) draws the botton side
of the surface, while `plot3d' (*note plot3d; Plot 3-d surface plot::)
only draws the surface as viewed from the top.

`x'  (`PLFLT *', input)

     Determines the way in which the surface is represented:

        * ``opt'=DRAW_LINEX': Lines are drawn showing ``z'' as a
          function of ``x'' for each value of ``y'[j]'.

        * ``opt'=DRAW_LINEY': Lines are drawn showing ``z'' as a

mesh can be colored accordingly to the current z value being plotted, a
contour plot can be drawn at the base XY plane, and a curtain can be
drawn between the plotted function border and the base XY plane.  The
arguments are identical to `plmeshc'. The only difference between

17.73 plpoly3: Draw a polygon in 3 space
========================================

     plpoly3 (n, x, y, z, draw, ifcc);

   Draws a polygon in 3 space defined by ``n'' points in ``x'', ``y'',
and ``z''.  Setup like `plline3' (*note plline3; Draw a line in 3
space::), but differs from that function in that `plpoly3' (*note
plpoly3; Draw a polygon in 3 space::) attempts to determine if the
polygon is viewable depending on the order of the points within the
arrays and the value of ``ifcc''. If the back of polygon is facing the
viewer, then it isn't drawn. If this isn't what you want, then use
`plline3' (*note plline3; Draw a line in 3 space::) instead.

   The points are assumed to be in a plane, and the directionality of
the plane is determined from the first three points. Additional points
do not have to lie on the plane defined by the first three, but if they
do not, then the determination of visibility obviously can't be 100%
accurate... So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar,
consider breaking them into smaller polygons. 3 points define a plane
:-).

   Bugs: If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if they
are colinear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance of being
correct. Avoid such situations :-). See `x18c.c' for an example of this
problem.  (Search for 20.1).

`n'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of points defining line.

`x'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array with x coordinates of points.

`y'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array with y coordinates of points.

`z'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array with z coordinates of points.

`draw'  (`PLBOOL *', input)
     Pointer to array which controls drawing the segments of the
     polygon. If ``draw[i]'' is true, then the polygon segment from
     index ``[i]'' to ``[i+1]'' is drawn, otherwise, not.

`ifcc'  (`PLBOOL', input)
     If ``ifcc'' is true the directionality of the polygon is
     determined by assuming the points are laid out in a
     counter-clockwise order. Otherwise, the directionality of the
     polygon is determined by assuming the points are laid out in a
     clockwise order.

`set'  (`PLINT', input)
     If ``set'' is equal to 0 then PLplot automatically determines the

17.84 plscmap1l: Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship
=============================================================================

     plscmap1l (itype, npts, pos, coord1, coord2, coord3, rev);

   Set color map1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship between
position in the color map (from 0 to 1) and position in HLS or RGB
color space (see *Note Color Map1: Color Map1.). May be called at any
time.

   The idea here is to specify a number of control points that define
the mapping between palette 1 input positions (intensities) and HLS (or
RGB). Between these points, linear interpolation is used which gives a
smooth variation of color with input position. Any number of control
points may be specified, located at arbitrary positions, although
typically 2 - 4 are enough. Another way of stating this is that we are
traversing a given number of lines through HLS (or RGB) space as we
move through color map1 entries. The control points at the minimum and
maximum position (0 and 1) must always be specified. By adding more
control points you can get more variation. One good technique for
plotting functions that vary about some expected average is to use an
additional 2 control points in the center (position ~= 0.5) that are
the same lightness as the background (typically white for paper output,
black for crt), and same hue as the boundary control points. This
allows the highs and lows to be very easily distinguished.

   Each control point must specify the position in color map1 as well as
three coordinates in HLS or RGB space. The first point must correspond
to position = 0, and the last to position = 1.

   The hue is interpolated around the "front" of the color wheel
(red<->green<->blue<->red) unless the "rev" flag is set to true, in
which case interpolation (between the `i' and `i + 1' control point for
`rev[i]') proceeds around the back (reverse) side. Specifying rev=NULL
is equivalent to setting rev[]= false for every control point.

`clevel'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array containing the data levels corresponding to the
     edges of each shaded region that will be plotted by this function.
     To work properly the levels should be monotonic.

`nlevel'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of shades plus 1 (i.e., the number of shade edge values in
     ``clevel'').

`fill_width'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines width used by the fill pattern.

`cont_color'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines pen color used for contours defining edges of shaded
     regions. The pen color is only temporary set for the contour
     drawing. Set this value to zero or less if no shade edge contours
     are wanted.

`cont_width'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines pen width used for contours defining edges of shaded
     regions. This value may not be honored by all drivers.  The pen
     width is only temporary set for the contour drawing. Set this
     value to zero or less if no shade edge contours are wanted.

`fill'  (`void (*) (PLINT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *)', input)

     routines.

`rectangular'  (`PLBOOL', input)
     Set ``rectangular'' to true if rectangles map to rectangles after
     coordinate transformation with ``pltrl''. Otherwise, set
     ``rectangular'' to false.  If ``rectangular'' is set to true,
     plshade tries to save time by filling large rectangles. This
     optimization fails if the coordinate transformation distorts the
     shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor coordinates has
     to have ``rectangular'' set to false.

     Pointer to function that defines transformation between indices in
     array ``z'' and the world coordinates (C only). Transformation
     functions are provided in the PLplot library: `pltr0' (*note
     pltr0; Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::) for
     identity mapping, and `pltr1' (*note pltr1; Linear interpolation

     mapping using doubly dimensioned coord arrays [column dominant; as
     per normal C 2d arrays]::) for arbitrary mappings respectively
     defined by one- and two-dimensional arrays. In addition,
     user-supplied routines for the transformation can be used as well.
     Examples of all of these approaches are given in *Note Contour
     Plots from C: Contour Plots from C..  The transformation function
     should have the form given by any of `pltr0' (*note pltr0;

   Shade individual region on the basis of value. Use `plshades' (*note
plshades; Shade regions on the basis of value::) if you want to shade a
number of contiguous regions using continuous colors. In particular the
edge contours are treated properly in `plshades' (*note plshades; Shade
regions on the basis of value::).  If you attempt to do contiguous
regions with `plshade1' (*note plshade1; Shade individual region on the
basis of value::) (or `plshade' (*note plshade; Shade individual region
on the basis of value::)) the contours at the edge of the shade are
partially obliterated by subsequent plots of contiguous shaded regions.
`plshade1' (*note plshade1; Shade individual region on the basis of
value::) differs from `plshade' (*note plshade; Shade individual region
on the basis of value::) by the type of the first argument. Look at the
argument list below, `plcont' (*note plcont; Contour plot::) and *Note

DOCUMENTATION, but as a stopgap look at how `plshade' (*note plshade;
Shade individual region on the basis of value::) is used in
`examples/c/x15c.c'

`a'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Contains array to be plotted. The array must have been declared as
     PLFLT a[nx][ny].

`nx'  (`PLINT', input)
     First dimension of array "a".

`ny'  (`PLINT', input)
     Second dimension of array "a".

`defined'  (`PLINT (*) (PLFLT, PLFLT)', input)
     User function specifying regions excluded from the shading plot.
     This function accepts x and y coordinates as input arguments and
     must return 0 if the point is in the excluded region or 1
     otherwise. This argument can be NULL if all the values are valid.

`xmin'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Defines the "grid" coordinates. The data a[0][0] has a position of
     (xmin,ymin), a[nx-1][0] has a position at (xmax,ymin) and so on.

`xmax'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Defines the "grid" coordinates. The data a[0][0] has a position of
     (xmin,ymin), a[nx-1][0] has a position at (xmax,ymin) and so on.

`ymin'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Defines the "grid" coordinates. The data a[0][0] has a position of
     (xmin,ymin), a[nx-1][0] has a position at (xmax,ymin) and so on.

`ymax'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Defines the "grid" coordinates. The data a[0][0] has a position of
     (xmin,ymin), a[nx-1][0] has a position at (xmax,ymin) and so on.

`shade_min'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Defines the lower end of the interval to be shaded. If shade_max
     <= shade_min, `plshade1' (*note plshade1; Shade individual region
     on the basis of value::) does nothing.

`shade_max'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Defines the upper end of the interval to be shaded. If shade_max
     <= shade_min, `plshade1' (*note plshade1; Shade individual region
     on the basis of value::) does nothing.

`sh_cmap'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines color map.

`sh_color'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Defines color map index if cmap0 or color map input value (ranging
     from 0. to 1.) if cmap1.

`sh_width'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines width used by the fill pattern.

`min_color'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region.
     The min values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max
     values are used on the shade_max boundary. Set color and width to
     zero for no plotted boundaries.

`min_width'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region.
     The min values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max
     values are used on the shade_max boundary. Set color and width to
     zero for no plotted boundaries.

`max_color'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region.
     The min values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max

`max_width'  (`PLINT', input)
     Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region.
     The min values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max
     values are used on the shade_max boundary. Set color and width to
     zero for no plotted boundaries.

`fill'  (`void (*) (PLINT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *)', input)
     Routine used to fill the region. Use `plfill' (*note plfill; Draw
     filled polygon::). Future version of plplot may have other fill
     routines.

`rectangular'  (`PLBOOL', input)
     Set ``rectangular'' to true if rectangles map to rectangles after
     coordinate transformation with ``pltrl''. Otherwise, set
     ``rectangular'' to false.  If ``rectangular'' is set to true,
     plshade tries to save time by filling large rectangles. This
     optimization fails if the coordinate transformation distorts the
     shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor coordinates has
     to have ``rectangular'' set to false.

`pltr'  (`void (*) (PLFLT, PLFLT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *, PLPointer)  ', input)
     Pointer to function that defines transformation between indices in
     array ``z'' and the world coordinates (C only). Transformation
     functions are provided in the PLplot library: `pltr0' (*note
     pltr0; Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::) for
     identity mapping, and `pltr1' (*note pltr1; Linear interpolation
     for grid to world mapping using singly dimensioned coord arrays::)
     and `pltr2' (*note pltr2; Linear interpolation for grid to world
     mapping using doubly dimensioned coord arrays [column dominant; as
     per normal C 2d arrays]::) for arbitrary mappings respectively
     defined by one- and two-dimensional arrays. In addition,
     user-supplied routines for the transformation can be used as well.
     Examples of all of these approaches are given in *Note Contour
     Plots from C: Contour Plots from C..  The transformation function
     should have the form given by any of `pltr0' (*note pltr0;
     Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::), `pltr1'

     Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using doubly
     dimensioned coord arrays [column dominant; as per normal C 2d
     arrays]::).

`pltr_data'  (`PLPointer', input)
     Extra parameter to help pass information to `pltr0' (*note pltr0;
     Identity transformation for grid to world mapping::), `pltr1'
     (*note pltr1; Linear interpolation for grid to world mapping using

keywords are the same as those printed out by `plstar' (*note plstar;
Initialization::). If the requested device is not available, or if the
input string is empty or begins with "?", the prompted startup of
`plstar' (*note plstar; Initialization::) is used. This routine also
divides the output device into ``nx'' by ``ny'' subpages, each of which
may be used independently. The subroutine `pladv' (*note pladv; Advance

program must switch back to the graphics window before issuing plot
commands, as the text (or console) device will probably become quite

the world coordinates. The style of the vector arrow may be set using
`plsvect' (*note plsvect; Set arrow style for vector plots::).

API that has already been documented in *Note The Common API for
PLplot: The Common API for PLplot..

   This chapter is a work that is just starting. There are many C
functions in the code base that are not part of the common API, and we
haven't even gotten to the point of listing them all. What gets
documented here now is whatever C-explicit code we are trying to
understand at the time.

18.1 plP_checkdriverinit: Checks to see if any  of the specified drivers have been initialized
==============================================================================================

     plP_checkdriverinit (list);

   Checks to see if any of the specified drivers have been initialized.
Function tests a space-delimited list of driver names to see how many
of the given drivers have been initialized, and how often.  The return
code of the function is: `0' if no matching drivers were found to have
been initialized; `-1' if an error occurred allocating the internal
buffer; or, a positive number indicating the number of streams
encountered that belong to drivers on the provided list. This function
invokes `plP_getinitdriverlist' (*note plP_getinitdriverlist; Get the
initialized-driver list::) internally to get a complete list of drivers
that have been initialized in order to compare with the driver names
specified in the argument list to `plP_checkdriverinit' (*note
plP_checkdriverinit; Checks to see if any of the specified drivers have
been initialized::).

`list'  (`char *', input)
     Pointer to character string specifying a space-delimited list of
     driver names, e.g., `"bmp jpeg tiff"'.

18.2 plP_getinitdriverlist: Get the initialized-driver  list
============================================================

     plP_getinitdriverlist (text_buffer);

   Get the initialized-driver list. Function returns a space-delimited
list of the currently initialized drivers or streams. If more than one
stream is using the same driver, then its name will be returned more
than once. The function can be analogously thought of as also returning
the names of the active streams. Invoked internally by
`plP_checkdriverinit' (*note plP_checkdriverinit; Checks to see if any
of the specified drivers have been initialized::).

`text_buffer'  (`char *', output)
     Pointer to a user-allocated buffer to hold the result. The user
     must ensure the buffer is big enough to hold the result.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: plabort; Error abort,  Next: plexit; Error exit,  Prev: plP_getinitdriverlist; Get the initialized-driver list,  Up: The Specialized C API for PLplot

18.3 plabort: Error abort
=========================

     plabort (message);

   This routine is to be used when something goes wrong that doesn't
require calling `plexit' (*note plexit; Error exit::) but for which
there is no useful recovery.  It calls the abort handler defined via
`plsabort' (*note plsabort; Set abort handler::), does some cleanup and
returns. The user can supply his/her own abort handler and pass it in
via `plsabort' (*note plsabort; Set abort handler::).

`message'  (`char *', input)
     Abort message.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: plexit; Error exit,  Next: plgfile; Get output file handle,  Prev: plabort; Error abort,  Up: The Specialized C API for PLplot

18.4 plexit: Error exit
=======================

     plexit (message);

   This routine is called in case an error is encountered during
execution of a PLplot routine. It prints the error message, tries to
release allocated resources, calls the handler prvided by `plsexit'
(*note plsexit; Set exit handler::) and then exits. If cleanup needs to
be done in the driver program then the user may want to supply his/her
own exit handler and pass it in via `plsexit' (*note plsexit; Set exit
handler::). This function should either call `plend' (*note plend; End
plotting session::) before exiting, or simply return.

`message'  (`char *', input)
     Error message.


File: plplotdoc.info,  Node: plgfile; Get output file handle,  Next: plsabort; Set abort handler,  Prev: plexit; Error exit,  Up: The Specialized C API for PLplot

18.5 plgfile: Get output file handle
====================================

     plgfile (file);

   Gets the current output file handle, if applicable.

`file'  (`FILE **', output)
     File pointer to current output file.

18.8 plsfile: Set output file handle
====================================

     plsfile (file);

   Sets the current output file handle, if applicable. If the file has
has not been previously opened and is required by the driver, the user
will be prompted for the file name. This routine, if used, must be
called before initializing PLplot.

`file'  (`FILE *', input)
     File pointer. The type (i.e. text or binary) doesn't matter on *ix
     systems. On systems where it might matter it should match the type
     of file that the output driver would produce, i.e. text for the
     postscript driver.

   When called from Fortran 95, this overloaded routine has the same
effect as when invoked from C. See `examples/f95/x??f.f90' for various
ways to call plcont from Fortran 95.

   The meaning of the various arguments is as follows:

`z'  (`real(kind=plflt), dimension(:,:)', input)
     Matrix containing the values to be plotted.

`kx, lx'  (`integer', input)
     Range for the first index in the matrix `z' to consider.  If not
     given, then the whole first index is considered.

`clevel'  (`real(kind=plflt), dimension(:)', input)
     Levels at which the contours are computed and drawn.

`kx, lx'  (`integer', input)
     Range for the first index in the matrix `z' to consider.  If not
     given, then the whole first index is considered.

`ky, ly'  (`integer', input)
     Range for the second index in the matrix `z' to consider.  If not
     given, then the whole second index is considered.

`xg'  (`real(kind=plft), dimension(:)' or  `real(kind=plft), dimension(:,:)', input)
     The x-coordinates for the grid lines (if one-dimensional) or the
     x-coordinates of the grid vertices (if two-dimensional).  The
     values in the matrix are plotted at these coordinates.  If not
     given, implicit coordinates are used (equal to the indices in the
     matrix).

`yg'  (`real(kind=plft), dimension(:)' or  `real(kind=plft), dimension(:,:)', input)
     The y-coordinates for the grid lines (if one-dimensional) or the
     x-coordinates of the grid vertices (if two-dimensional).  The
     values in the matrix are plotted at these coordinates.

`tr'  (`real(kind=plft), dimension(6)', input)
     The coefficients of an affine transformation:


                          x = tr(1) * ix + tr(2) * iy + tr(3)
                          y = tr(4) * ix + tr(5) * iy + tr(6)

     The indices of the matrix element are used to compute the "actual"
     coordinates according to the above formulae.

   When called from Fortran 95, this routine has the same effect as when
invoked from C. The interpretation of all parameters (see `plmesh'

19.7 plparseopts: parse arguments for Fortran 95
================================================

     plparseopts (mode);

   When called from Fortran 95, this routine has the same effect as
when invoked from C (see `plparseopts' (*note plparseopts; Parse
command-line arguments::)) except that the argument list just contains
the parsing mode and the Fortran 95 system routines `iargc' and `getarg'
are used internally to obtain the number of arguments and argument
values. (Note, during configuration, the user's Fortran 95 compiler is
checked to see whether it supports `iargc' and `getarg'. If it does
not, the Fortran 95 plparseopts simply writes a warning message and
returns.

`mode'  (`PLINT', input)
     Parsing mode; see `plparseopts' (*note plparseopts; Parse
     command-line arguments::) for details.

=====================================================================

     plsesc (esc);

   Set the escape character for text strings. From Fortran 95 it needs
to be the decimal ASCII value. Only selected characters are allowed to
prevent the user from shooting himself in the foot (For example, a \
isn't allowed since it conflicts with C's use of backslash as a
character escape). Here are the allowed escape characters and their
corresponding decimal ASCII values:

   * !, ASCII 33

   * #, ASCII 35

   * $, ASCII 36

   * %, ASCII 37

   * &, ASCII 38

   * *, ASCII 42

   * @, ASCII 64

20.1 plcon0: Contour plot, identity mapping for Fortran 77
==========================================================

     plcon0 (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel);

   Draws a contour plot of the data in ``z'[`nx'][`ny']', using the
``nlevel'' contour levels specified by ``clevel''.  Only the region of
the array from ``kx'' to ``lx'' and from ``ky'' to ``ly'' is plotted
out. See *Note Contour and Shade Plots: Contour and Shade Plots. for
more information.

`z'  (`PLFLT **', input)
     Pointer to a vectored two-dimensional array containing data to be
     contoured.

`nx, ny'  (`PLINT', input)
     Physical dimensions of array ``z''.

`kx, lx'  (`PLINT', input)
     Range of `x' indices to consider.

`ky, ly'  (`PLINT', input)
     Range of `y' indices to consider.

`clevel'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointer to array specifying levels at which to draw contours.

`nlevel'  (`PLINT', input)
     Number of contour levels to draw.

   NOTE: this function is intended for use from a Fortran 77 caller
only.  The C user should instead call `plcont' (*note plcont; Contour
plot::) using the built-in transformation function `pltr0' for the same
capability.

   Draws a contour plot of the data in ``z'[`nx'][`ny']', using the
``nlevel'' contour levels specified by ``clevel''.  Only the region of
the array from ``kx'' to ``lx'' and from ``ky'' to ``ly'' is plotted
out. The arrays ``xg'' and ``yg'' are used to specify the
transformation between array indices and world coordinates. See *Note
Contour and Shade Plots: Contour and Shade Plots. for more information.

     Number of contour levels to draw.

`xg, yg'  (`PLFLT *', input)
     Pointers to arrays which specify the transformation from array
     indices to world coordinates. These must be one-dimensional
     arrays, used for a transformation of the form: `tx' = `f(x)', `ty'
     = `f(y)'. Function values at locations between grid points are
     obtained via linear interpolation.

   NOTE: this function is intended for use from a Fortran 77 caller
only.  The C user should instead call `plcont' (*note plcont; Contour

20.4 plcont: Contour plot, fixed linear mapping for Fortran 77
==============================================================

     plcont (z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel);

   When called from Fortran 77, this routine has the same effect as when
invoked from C. The interpretation of all parameters (see `plcont'
(*note plcont; Contour plot::)) is also the same except there is no
transformation function supplied as the last parameter. Instead, a
6-element array specifying coefficients to use in the transformation is
supplied via the named common block `plplot' (see code). Since this
approach is somewhat inflexible, the user is recommended to call either
of `plcon0' (*note plcon0; Contour plot; identity mapping for Fortran
77::), `plcon1' (*note plcon1; Contour plot; general 1-d mapping for
Fortran 77::), or `plcon2' (*note plcon2; Contour plot; general 2-d
mapping for Fortran 77::) instead.

20.5 plvec0: Vector plot, identity mapping for Fortran 77
=========================================================

     plvec0 (u, v, nx, ny, scale);

   Draws a vector plot of the data in `(`u'[`nx'][`ny'],
`v'[`nx'][`ny'])'.

`u, v'  (`PLFLT **', input)
     Pointer to a pair of vectored two-dimensional arrays containing
     the x and y components of the vector to be plotted.

`nx, ny'  (`PLINT', input)
     Physical dimensions of the arrays ``u'' and ``v''.

`scale'  (`PLFLT', input)
     Parameter to control the scaling factor of the vectors for
     plotting.  If ``scale' = 0' then the scaling factor is
     automatically calculated for the data.  If ``scale' < 0' then the
     scaling factor is automatically calculated for the data and then
     multiplied by `-`scale''.  If ``scale' > 0' then the scaling
     factor is set to ``scale''.

   When called from Fortran 77, this routine has the same effect as when
invoked from C. The interpretation of all parameters (see `plmesh'

20.11 plparseopts: parse arguments for Fortran 77
=================================================

     plparseopts (mode);

   When called from Fortran 77, this routine has the same effect as
when invoked from C (see `plparseopts' (*note plparseopts; Parse
command-line arguments::)) except that the argument list just contains
the parsing mode and the Fortran 77 system routines `iargc' and `getarg'
are used internally to obtain the number of arguments and argument
values. (Note, during configuration, the user's Fortran 77 compiler is
checked to see whether it supports `iargc' and `getarg'. If it does
not, the Fortran 77 plparseopts simply writes a warning message and
returns.

`mode'  (`PLINT', input)
     Parsing mode; see `plparseopts' (*note plparseopts; Parse
     command-line arguments::) for details.

======================================================================

     plsesc (esc);

   Set the escape character for text strings. From Fortran 77 it needs
to be the decimal ASCII value. Only selected characters are allowed to
prevent the user from shooting himself in the foot (For example, a \
isn't allowed since it conflicts with C's use of backslash as a
character escape). Here are the allowed escape characters and their
corresponding decimal ASCII values:

   * !, ASCII 33

   * #, ASCII 35

   * $, ASCII 36

   * %, ASCII 37

   * &, ASCII 38

   * *, ASCII 42

   * @, ASCII 64

   * ^, ASCII 94

   * ~, ASCII 126

21 API compatibility definition
*******************************

This chapter presents the formal definition of what is considered to be
in the PLplot library API. It is assumed that major new releases of
PLplot will have substantial backwards incompatible changes in the API,
but the PLplot developers commit to introducing as few as possible of
such incompatibilities between minor releases such that stability
across those minor releases is practically guaranteed. In all cases
where backwards incompatible changes have been introduced, then the
library soname will be changed (for operating systems such as Linux
that support versioned shared libraries).

   The information in this chapter regards version 5.7.4 of PLplot,
released on 2007-08-13.

The formal definition of the PLplot C API is everything that is defined
in the include file `plplot.h'. This includes all the function
prototypes, the defined structures and the semantics of the constants.
The list of symbols currently exported by the shared library
`libplplot.h' that are declared in `plplot.h' is the following:

   Another important aspect of compatibility regard the Application
Binary Interface (ABI). Backwards compatibility can be broken by
changes in the C structures made public through `plplot.h'. Currently,
they are:

     typedef struct {
         char *opt;
         int  (*handler)	(char *, char *, void *);
         void *client_data;
         void *var;
         long mode;
         char *syntax;
         char *desc;
     } PLOptionTable;

     typedef struct {
         int type;			/* of event (CURRENTLY UNUSED) */
         unsigned int state;		/* key or button mask */
         unsigned int keysym;	/* key selected */
         unsigned int button;	/* mouse button selected */
         PLINT subwindow;            /* subwindow (alias subpage, alias subplot) number */
         char string[PL_MAXKEY];	/* translated string */
         int pX, pY;			/* absolute device coordinates of pointer */
         PLFLT dX, dY;		/* relative device coordinates of pointer */
         PLFLT wX, wY;		/* world coordinates of pointer */
     } PLGraphicsIn;

     typedef struct {
         PLFLT dxmi, dxma, dymi, dyma;	/* min, max window rel dev coords */
         PLFLT wxmi, wxma, wymi, wyma;	/* min, max window world coords */
     } PLWindow;

     typedef struct {
         unsigned int x, y;			/* upper left hand corner */
         unsigned int width, height;		/* window dimensions */
     } PLDisplay;

     typedef struct {
         PLFLT *f;
         PLINT nx, ny, nz;
     } PLfGrid;

     typedef struct {
         PLFLT **f;
         PLINT nx, ny;
     } PLfGrid2;

     typedef struct {
         PLFLT *xg, *yg, *zg;
         PLINT nx, ny, nz;
     } PLcGrid;

     typedef struct {

         unsigned char g;		/* green */
         unsigned char b;		/* blue */
         char *name;
     } PLColor;

     typedef struct {
         PLFLT h;			/* hue */
         PLFLT l;			/* lightness */
         PLFLT s;			/* saturation */
         PLFLT p;			/* position */
         int rev;			/* if set, interpolate through h=0 */
     } PLControlPt;

     typedef struct {
         PLINT cmd;
         PLINT result;
     } PLBufferingCB;

21.2 Regression test for backwards compatibility
================================================

Since PLplot is developed by so many people, the task of checking for
backwards compatiblity of the library is very hard. As for the 5.3.1
release, we do not have any rigorous regression test for check whether
the library is really backwards compatible.

   However, here are some rules to be followed by the Release Manager
prior to releasing a new version of PLplot:

   * Check if there are any changes in `plplot.h'. If no prototype is
     changed, then the chances are high that no backwards
     compatibilities have been introduced. If new functions has been
     added, then the library soname will be kept, although the libtool
     soversion string in `configure.ac' must be changed from `x:y:z' to
     `(x+1):0:(z+1)'. See the libtool manual for details.

   * A necessary, but not sufficient test consists of the following:
     first, install the previous released version of PLplot in the
     system and compile all the examples `examples/c/x??c.'. After
     that, install the to-be-released version of PLplot and try to run
     the previously compiled examples. If they either link or run
     incorrectly, then backwards incompatibilities have been introduced
     and the soversion string must be upgraded from `x:y:z' to
     `(x+1):0:0'.

22 Obsolete/Deprecated API for PLplot
*************************************

The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimal documentation for
obsolete/deprecated API that appears in our C library to provide
backwards compatibility until our next major release, PLplot-6, where
these functions will disappear. Do not use these functions, and if you
already use them in legacy PLplot applications, replace them by the
suggested equivalents so you won't be caught out by the next major
PLplot release.

`--with-double'.  Here is the complete list of configuration options:


     ./configure --help

   The configure script looks for default configuration options first
in `./cf_plplot.in'.  If that file is not found, the script then looks
in `$HOME/config/cf_plplot.in'.  Finally, if neither file is found or
if the found file does not have a particular default option, then the
script uses the above defaults. Here is one example of a default
configuration file. Adapt this for your needs or else use the
command-line parameters for the configuration file.

23.1.2 Linux/Unix Building of C Programmes that Use the   Installed PLplot Libraries
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is incomplete. NEEDS DOCUMENTATION.  `$prefix/bin/plplot-config'
is a useful tool for helping with building of C programmes that use the
PLplot libraries.


     ./plplot-config --help
     Usage: plplot-config [OPTIONS]
     Options:
             [--prefix[=DIR]]
     	[--version]
     	[--libs]
     	[--cflags]
     	[--with-c++]
     	[--help]

For example, the `--cflags' parameter displays the flags for compiling,
and the `--libs' parameter displays the flags for linking your
application. The displayed flags are exactly consistent with the
configuration specified when PLplot was last built and installed.
