plplot (5.8.0~RC1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The psttf driver is dropped in this release.  The cairo driver
    provides all of its functionality and will replace it eventually.  The
    plplot9-driver-cairo package has relationships Conflicts/Replaces with
    plplot9-driver-pstff, which should make the transition smoother for
    the users.
