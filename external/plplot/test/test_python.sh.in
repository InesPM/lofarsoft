# This is called from plplot-test.sh with $pythondir, $device,
# $dsuffix, and $options defined.
# $pythondir must be the build tree and not the source tree (if separate from
# build tree) since must access plplot_python_start.py in build tree and
# paths in that file are relative to build tree.
# Skip 14 and 17 because they are interactive.
# Skip 19 because it is just a placeholder without a real implementation.
# Skip 20, 21 and 25 because they are not (yet) implemented.
# For 24 you need special fonts installed to get good result.
