# To build the c++ examples before running this script do the following:
# pushd $cxxdir; make; popd

# x01cc is a C++ alternative that has no corresponding examples for the
# other front ends.

# Do the standard non-interactive examples.
# skip 14 because it requires two output files.
# skip 17 because it is interactive.
