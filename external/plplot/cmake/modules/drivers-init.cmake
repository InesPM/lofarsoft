# Module to initialize device options.

# Results are contained in the following variables:
# PLD_devicename (ON or OFF): whether each PLplot-related device is enabled
#   or not.  devicename is png, jpeg, etc.
# DRIVERS_DEVICE_LIST: see below for the definition

# We think of a "device" as the output medium.  Could be a machine
# style (Tektronix, X11), or a file format (Postscript).
#
# A "driver" is the PLplot code that produces the output on the
# medium.
#
# Some drivers support multiple devices.  But we we need to make sure
# we compile only the selected drivers.  That is, if a driver supports
# devices not selected, we don't want to compile it at all.  Or if it
# supports multiple selected devices, we only want to compile it
# once.  To support this, we build an association list between devices
# and drivers.  This will be inspected to build up the set of drivers
# to be compiled based on which devices are selected.
