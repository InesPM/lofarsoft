Release announcements for PLplot in DocBook-XML format
------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the source files in DocBook-XML format for the
PLplot release announcements starting at version > 5.2.1.  It contains also
the stylesheets and the Makefile for building the output files.

XHTML, PDF, and text versions can be obtained from a XML source.  The
Makefile has generic (pattern) rules to build the output formats.  For
instance, if one has a source file called announce.xml, then the following
command:

    make SOURCES=announce

will build the files announce.xhtml, announce.pdf, and announce.txt.
Notice that the value of the SOURCES variable is the name of the input file
with the extension ".xml" stripped off.  This also works:

    make announce.txt

There are also "clean" and "validate" make targets.  The "validate" target
runs an XML validation program.

The Makefile uses specific constructs of GNU make and is unlikely to be
widely portable.  The programs and respective (Debian) packages needed are:

    xmlto     xmlto_0.0.14
    links     elinks_0.4.2
    onsgmls   opensp_1.5release
