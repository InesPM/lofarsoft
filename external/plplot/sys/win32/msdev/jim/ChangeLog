	* jim.c, jimsh.c: Rework of the [scan] command finished. It does
	  not any longer use sscanf for scanning purposes, only for parsing
	  within SetScanFmtFromAny. We could get rid of it there too, if
	  necessary.

	  It pass all tests on all platforms I had access to (mainly Linux,
	  Solaris, FreeBSD, MacOS X). But I am confident, that it will pass
	  on the others as well.

	  A small new introduced C99-ism was fixed in jimsh.c as well.

2005-04-09 14:57  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Experimental verison of JIM_EVAL retcode
	  in order to implement what RHS proposed in the Wiki for tail
	  recursion:

	  return -code eval [list proc $a $b ...]

	  I'm not sure I'll take this, but it needs to be inside for some
	  time in order to experiment and evaluate it I guess.

2005-04-09 10:23  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, jim-readline.c, jim-rlprompt-1.0.tcl, jim.c,
	  jim.h, jimsh.c: .jimrc support (or jimrc.tcl). Minimal readline

	  evident bias due to some programming error probably.

2005-03-29 15:38  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, jim.c, jim.h: A number of fix for commands
	  optimizing a bit too much objects not shared, that didn't played

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: expr's || and && operators are now lazy.

2005-03-21 18:04  chi

	* jim.c, jim.h: Add copyright notice within jim.c & jim.h to
	  acknowledge Jim's license.

2005-03-21 13:39  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, test.tcl: Modified test.tcl to report the list
	  of failed tests at the end.

2005-03-21 12:59  chi

	* jim.c, jim.h, test.tcl: Add the [scan] command and the
	  Jim_ScanString function + tests.

	    The scanformat specification will be converted to a new Jim_Obj
	  of type
	  scanFormatStringObjType, that will contain the parsed
	  representation within its internal object representation. This
	  speed up multiple scanning within e.g. a loop, of objects were
	  cached.

	    For internal scanning we use sscanf currently (I am lazy right
	  now). That
	  means also, we will inherit its incapability to handle string
	  with embedded ZERO. It would be not too difficult to implement
	  another scanner just for the string and charset conversion type
	  that could be able to handle those embedded ZEROs, however.

	  Furthermore two small details were fixed:

	  1. Jim_DoubleToString should also recognize a number if a leading
	  '+' or    '-' occured. By recognizing I mean, add a ".0" to such
	  a number.

	  2. Jim_StrDupLen should also properly handle duplication of
	  substrings. So    now it should be possible to do this:

	       const char *str1 = "This is a long string";
	       char *substr1 = Jim_StrDupLen(str1, 4);

	     Now substr1 should contain a properly ZERO ended "This".

2005-03-14 10:16  antirez

	  -DJIM_ANSIC to use only ANSI-C features and libraries.

2005-03-12 10:18  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: Added the Jim_FreeNewObj() macro to free
	  objects with refcount == 0 instead to call Jim_IncrRefCount +
	  Jim_DecrRefCount(), or directly Jim_FreeObj(). Code modified
	  accordingly where needed.  Make test + valgrind test passed after
	  the change.

2005-03-12 09:52  antirez

	* ChangeLog, README, jim.c: It's now possible to exclude
	  compilation of dynamic loaded libraries commenting the JIM_DYNLIB
	  define from the first lines of jim.c.

2005-03-12 07:43  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Modified Jim_Free() to be more strict, now it
	  panics if the refcount of the object is not exactly 0.  Now new
	  objects that are not used may be freed using Jim_Free instead to
	  use Jim_IncrRefCount() + Jim_DecrRefCount() calls.

2005-03-11 23:00  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Converted some free() call to Jim_Free().
	  Actually Jim_Free is a macro that just expands to free for now,

	  more handy in mani conditions.

2005-03-08 16:10  patthoyts

	* bench.tcl, jim.c, jim.h: JIM_VERSION is to be an integer value

	  tables elements).

2005-03-07 18:58  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Added "increasing", "decreasing", "ascii",
	  "nocase" options to lsort (SS). The plan is to don't add more

2005-03-07 17:03  antirez

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, bench.tcl, jim.c: [lsort] command and list

2005-03-07 09:23  antirez

	* ChangeLog, TODO: TODO changes

2005-03-06 23:42  antirez

	* bench.tcl, jim.c, regtest.tcl, test.tcl: A specializing version
	  of [for] that appears able to match the performaces of Tcl8.4 for
	  the specialized forms. The implementation is a bit complex so may
	  contain bugs... to handle with care.	Also a [for] bug about
	  [continue] was fixed and the regression test added.

2005-03-06 11:43  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h, doc/AIO-Extension.txt: Fixed a race

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, TODO, jim-aio.c, jim.c, jim.h: Added
	  Jim_GetEnum() API function. StringCoreCommand and AIO extension
	  modified to use this API. There are plenty of other places where
	  this will work better than the raw CompareStringImmediate().
	  Original idea from Tcl, Original implementation from Pat Thoyts,
	  I changed the implementationto use CSI and for automatic error
	  generation with all the valid options listed.

2005-03-05 23:06  patthoyts

2005-03-05 13:22  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim-posix.c, jim-win32.c, jim-win32com.c, jim.c,

2005-03-03 15:41  antirez

2005-03-03 14:13  antirez

	* Makefile: Makefile dependences updated

2005-03-03 14:10  antirez

	  good job with zero length unicode strings.

2005-03-03 02:48  patthoyts

	* jim-win32com.c, jim.c, jim.h: Exported the double object type to

	* Makefile, jim-posix.c, jim-win32.c, jim-win32com.c, jim.c, jim.h:
	  shell and library splitted. Now jim.c contains only the language
	  implementation, while the shell is into jimsh.c, that is actually
	  the first example of embedder of Jim.

	  Important changes in jim.h to make Jim play well with
	  extensions/embedders at the same time, and to deal with multiple
	  files.

	  Extensions now must define JIM_EXTENSION before to include jim.h,
	  embedders must define JIM_EMBEDDED before to include jim.h.

2005-03-02 18:05  antirez

	* jim-posix.c, jim-win32.c, jim-win32com.c: removed JIM_EXTENSION

	  substitution in string

2005-03-02 14:31  antirez

	* jim.c, jim.h: JIM_LL_MODIFIER is now called JIM_WIDE_MODIFIER so
	  that's set simply to "ld" if the system isn't 64bit capable. This
	  allows to remove few ifdefs from jim.c.

2005-03-02 13:36  antirez

	* STYLE, bench.tcl, jim.c: non local literal sharing disabled.
	  bench.tcl modified to be more verbose.

	  about exported symbols restriction.

2005-02-28 20:29  antirez

	* jim.c, test.tcl: Foreach command! Thanks to Clemens.	Also a
	  patch about empty string and StringAppendString causing memory
	  corruption, and a patch about Jim_WrongNumArgs that I modified
	  because caused other tests to fail.

2005-02-28 17:27  patthoyts
