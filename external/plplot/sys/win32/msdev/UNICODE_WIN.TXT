INFORMATION ON UNICODE, ADDITIONAL DEVICES AND ANTI-ALIASING FONTS
==================================================================

Belongs to PLplot version: 5.6.0
Information updated:       april 2006


The following libraries and other files are required for the GIF, JPEG
and PNG devices, UNICODE and anti-aliasing:

1. The BGD library from: http://www.boutel.com/gd

2. The freetype library from: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm

3. Fonts

ad 1.
The BGD library is used for generating plots in PNG, JPEG en GIF format.
It also uses the freetype2 library for plotting characters beyond the
basic ASCII table (the UNICODE characters)

Steps:
- Install the binary distribution of that library in a convenient location
  (for instance c:\plplot\gdwin32 - this is the location for the
  current build procedure
- Build the import library using "makemsvcimport.bat"

The PLplot library will then depend on the presence of the bgd.dll
library somewhere in the path or in the directory holding the
executable.

ad 2.
The freetype library offers support for anti-aliasing fonts, this gives
text a smooth appearance.

Steps:
- The freetype2 library is best installed in c:\program files\freetype -
  this path seems to be used in the code itself, at least as prebuilt.
  Install all the zip-files you find on the site:
  - binaries
  - dependencies
  - developer files
  (All seem to be needed)

The PLplot library will then depend on the freetype6.dll library.

Fonts
-----
For more information on the fonts that can be used and how they can be
selected, consult the documentation for the WINGCC driver, as the
same mechanism is used (i.e. defaults are used for the 30 fonts
that are distinguished and environment variables allow you to
override the actual font that is used).
