	  <dt>Question:</dt>
	  <dd>"I seem to remember there was some script "build.sh" which would
	  drive the build of the various packages; is this no longer supported?"</dd>
	  <dt>Answer:</dt>
	  <dd>Yes, initially the complete build and installation was run through a
	  shell script, but this has been phased out in favor of having CMake do
	  most of the job. The method therefore to build any of the packages is
	  \code
	  cd $LOFARSOFT/build
	  make <package>
	  \endcode</dd>

	  <dt>Question:</dt>
	  <dd>"When I am running a command like e.g. <tt>make dal</tt> from within
	  the build directory, all I am getting is
	  \verbatim
	  make: *** No rule to make target `dal'.  Stop.
	  \endverbatim
	  Why is that?</dd>
	  <dt>Answer:</dt>
	  <dd>The most likely explanation is that you haven't yet run CMake to
	  parse the master configuration script to create the list of build
	  targets.
	  \code
	  cd $LOFARSOFT/build
	  ./bootstrap
	  \endcode
	  Once you have done this you can use 
	  \code
	  make help
	  \endcode
	  to get the list of available targets which can be build through
	  \code
	  make <package>
	  \endcode
	  </dd>
