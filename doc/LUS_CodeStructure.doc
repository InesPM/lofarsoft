  \page LUS_CodeStructure LUS :: Organization of the code

  The code in the LOFAR User Software (LUS) repository is organized as follows:

  \verbatim
  lofarsoft
  |-- data
  |-- doc
  |-- release
  |-- build
  |-- devel_common
  |   |-- cmake
  |   |-- scripts
  |   `-- templates
  |-- external
  |   |-- cfitsio
  |   |-- casacore
  |   |-- hdf5
  |   |-- plplot
  |   |-- swig
  |   `-- wcslib
  `-- src
      |-- contrib
      |-- CR-Tools
      |-- DAL
      |-- LASA
      |-- pipeline
      |-- pybdsm

  \endverbatim

  In this:

  <table border=0>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td width="15%">\b lofarsoft</td>
      <td width="80%">Root of the User Software code tree - go there if you
      want to synchronize your local working version against the repository.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td width="15%">\b build</td>
      <td width="80%">Directory used for building individual packages in the code
	distribution; using a separate directory for this purpose makes it easy to
     	simply erase all compile and link attempts and start again from a clean
	plate.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr valign=top>
	<td width="15%">\b devel_common</td>
	<td width="80%">Directory holding common tools for development; this
	includes e.g. the find scripts for CMake or file templates for creating
	new C++ classes. Unless you consider collaborating on the framework, you
	will not need to touch this (but you will need it).</td>
     </tr>
     <tr valign=top>
	<td width="15%">\b doc</td>
	<td width="80%">Local version of the Doxygen-based source code
	documentation.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr valign=top>
	<td width="15%">\b external</td>
	<td width="80%">Hosts the various \ref build_targets_external which will
	be required to build parts of the LOFAR User Software.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr valign=top>
	<td width="15%">\b src</td>
	<td width="80%">Contains the source code of the various projects and
	packages developed and written within the framework of the USG.</td>
