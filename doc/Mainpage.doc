  More LOFAR documentation:

  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/lofar/lofar-imaging-cookbook">LOFAR imaging cookbook</a> was initially  written by Timothy Garn, who was its main author till his death in 2009. Currently, Roberto Pizzo is in charge of udating it thanks to the contributions of the Lofar commissioners.  The manual explains how to manually reduce imaging data and inspect the results, using tools from the standard imaging pipeline (NDPPP, BBS, and MWImager). 

    <li><a href="http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/lofar-beamformed-data-pipeline-cookbook/lofar-beamformed-data-pipeline">LOFAR Beamformed-Data Pipeline Cookbook</a>

    <li><a href="http://usg.lofar.org/documentation/pipeline">LOFAR pipeline
    system</a>: This system has largely been developed to support the LOFAR
    imaging pipeline, but is now being deployed for a variety of science pipelines
    on the LOFAR cluster. This document is split into three sections: the first
    describes the aims of the framework, the structure of a pipeline, and gives
    an overview of how the system fits together, as well as information on how to
    run pre-defined pipelines. The second provides a tutorial introduction to
    writing pipelines and pipeline components. The third describes the framework
    codebase in more detail, and is intended for pipeline authors who wish to dig
    a little deeper, as well as those interested in developing the framework   
    itself. The fourth provides a guide to the imaging pipeline itself.
