<h2><a name="LOFAR User Software Group">LOFAR User Software Group</a></h2>

The <a href="http://usg.lofar.org">LOFAR User Software Group</a> represents a
collaborative effort between the <a href="http://www.lofar.org">LOFAR</a>
project and the scientific community as represented by the Key Science Projects
(KSPs). It is intended to serve both a coordination role as well as contribute
to the project software development. The USG effort is overseen by the LOFAR
Science Office (LSO) and will ultimately include a mix of developers and
scientists from the LSO, the LOFAR Engineering Group (LEG), and each of the
KSPs.

The primary task of the USG is to work with the LOFAR engineering and
calibration groups and the KSPs to provide a coherent set of software for
scientific investigations with LOFAR. This remit can include a variety of
activities including software development, prototyping, algorithm specification,
documentation, and testing. The specific activities of the USG are designed to
support the scientific programs of the KSPs and, by extension, ultimately the
needs of the general LOFAR user.

The final result of the user software project will be a software bundle
containing a mix of software developed by the LOFAR engineering group, adapted
3rd party software, and newly developed tools which allow users to reduce and
analyse LOFAR data. In addition, the USG performs the following functions:

<ul>
  <li>Coordinate KSP software development with the LOFAR engineering and
      calibration groups
  <li>Coordinate software development with contributing national and
      international partners
  <li>Identify and support common development tasks among the KSPs
  <li>Provide tools and software of general use to all KSPs
  <li>Evaluate and integrate third-party software
  <li>Provide scientific requirements for standard products and formats
  <li>Provide guidelines for development and documentation of software
  <li>Check compliance to these guidelines
  <li>Develop testing tools and procedures
  <li>Compile general documentation
  <li>Maintain a generally accessible software repository
  <li>Represent the interests of the LOFAR user community in other software consortia
</ul>

<h2><a name="Organization of the code">Organization of the code</a></h2>

A copy of the source code can be obtained through read-only access to the USG
code repository:
\verbatim
svn co http://usg.lofar.org/svn/code/trunk lofarsoft
\endverbatim
Once the check-out is completed, you will find the following directory structure
on your disk:
\verbatim
lofarsoft
|-- data
|-- doc
|-- release
|-- build
|-- devel_common
|   |-- cmake
|   |-- scripts
|   `-- templates
|-- external
|   |-- casacore
|   |-- hdf5
|   `-- wcslib
`-- src
    |-- contrib
    |-- CR-Tools
    |-- DAL
    |-- pybdsm
    `-- RM
\endverbatim
In this:
<ul>
  <li>\b lofarsoft is the root of the User Software code tree - go there if you
  want to synchronize your local working version against the repository.
  <li>\b build is used for building individual packages in the code
  distribution; using a separate directory for this purpose makes it easy to
  simply erase all compile and link attempts and start again from a clean plate.
  <li>\b devel_common hold common tools for development; this includes e.g.
  the find scripts for CMake or file templates for creating new C++ classes. Unless
  you consider collaborating on the framework, you will not need to touch this
  (but you will need it).
  <li>\b doc contains a local version of the Doxygen-based source code
  documentation; just go in there, fire up Doxygen and get an up-to-date version
  of the source code documentation.
  <li>\b external hosts the various external packages which will be required
  to build parts of the LOFAR User Software.
  <li>\b src contains the source code of the various projects and packages 
  developed and written within the framework of the USG. The main components are:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="group__CR.html">CR-Tools</a> - Tools for the analysis of cosmic ray data.
    <li><a href="group__DAL.html">DAL</a> - The <i>Data Access Library</i> is the interface for the creation of
    and access to LOFAR's standard data products.
    <li><a href="group__pybdsm.html">pybdsm</a> - <i>Blob detection and source modelling</i> package developed by the
    Surveys KSP.
    <li><a href="group__RM.html">RM</a> - Rotation-measure synthesis imaging package developed by the
	Cosmic Magnetism KSP.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Installation from source">Installation from source</a></h2>

In order to install modules/packages the following simple steps are required:
<ol>
  <li>Change into the \e build directory and run the \e bootstrap script:
  \code
  cd build
  ./bootstrap
  \endcode
  The script will check if there is a recent enough version of CMake available
  <li>Run \e make for the package/module in question, e.g. for the
  <a href="group__DAL.html">Data Access Library</a>
  \code
  make dal
  \endcode
  Typing
  \code
  make help
  \endcode
  will provide you with a list of available build targets.
</ol>
