\section usg_intro LOFAR User Software Group

The <a href="http://usg.lofar.org">LOFAR User Software Group</a> represents a
collaborative effort between the <a href="http://www.lofar.org">LOFAR</a>
project and the scientific community as represented by the Key Science Projects
(KSPs). It is intended to serve both a coordination role as well as contribute
to the project software development. The USG effort is overseen by the LOFAR
Science Office (LSO) and will ultimately include a mix of developers and
scientists from the LSO, the LOFAR Engineering Group (LEG), and each of the
KSPs.

The primary task of the USG is to work with the LOFAR engineering and
calibration groups and the KSPs to provide a coherent set of software for
scientific investigations with LOFAR. This remit can include a variety of
activities including software development, prototyping, algorithm specification,
documentation, and testing. The specific activities of the USG are designed to
support the scientific programs of the KSPs and, by extension, ultimately the
needs of the general LOFAR user.

The final result of the user software project will be a software bundle
containing a mix of software developed by the LOFAR engineering group, adapted
3rd party software, and newly developed tools which allow users to reduce and
analyse LOFAR data. In addition, the USG performs the following functions:

<ul>
  <li>Coordinate KSP software development with the LOFAR engineering and
      calibration groups
  <li>Coordinate software development with contributing national and
      international partners
  <li>Identify and support common development tasks among the KSPs
  <li>Provide tools and software of general use to all KSPs
  <li>Evaluate and integrate third-party software
  <li>Provide scientific requirements for standard products and formats
  <li>Provide guidelines for development and documentation of software
  <li>Check compliance to these guidelines
  <li>Develop testing tools and procedures
  <li>Compile general documentation
  <li>Maintain a generally accessible software repository
  <li>Represent the interests of the LOFAR user community in other software consortia
</ul>
