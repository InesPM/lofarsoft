\section usg_intro LOFAR User Software Group

The <a href="http://usg.lofar.org">LOFAR User Software Group</a> represents a
collaborative effort between the <a href="http://www.lofar.org">LOFAR</a>
project and the scientific community as represented by the Key Science Projects
(KSPs). It is intended to serve both a coordination role as well as contribute
to the project software development. The USG effort is overseen by the LOFAR
Science Office (LSO) and will ultimately include a mix of developers and
scientists from the LSO, the LOFAR Engineering Group (LEG), and each of the
KSPs.

The primary task of the USG is to work with the LOFAR engineering and
calibration groups and the KSPs to provide a coherent set of software for
scientific investigations with LOFAR. This remit can include a variety of
activities including software development, prototyping, algorithm specification,
documentation, and testing. The specific activities of the USG are designed to
support the scientific programs of the KSPs and, by extension, ultimately the
needs of the general LOFAR user.

The final result of the user software project will be a software bundle
containing a mix of software developed by the LOFAR engineering group, adapted
3rd party software, and newly developed tools which allow users to reduce and
analyse LOFAR data. In addition, the USG performs the following functions:

<ul>
  <li>Coordinate KSP software development with the LOFAR engineering and
      calibration groups
  <li>Coordinate software development with contributing national and
      international partners
  <li>Identify and support common development tasks among the KSPs
  <li>Provide tools and software of general use to all KSPs
  <li>Evaluate and integrate third-party software
  <li>Provide scientific requirements for standard products and formats
  <li>Provide guidelines for development and documentation of software
  <li>Check compliance to these guidelines
  <li>Develop testing tools and procedures
  <li>Compile general documentation
  <li>Maintain a generally accessible software repository
  <li>Represent the interests of the LOFAR user community in other software consortia
</ul>

  <b>Setting up your working copy</b>

  <ol>
    <li>For the initial checkout of your working copy run:
    \verbatim
    svn co http://usg.lofar.org/svn/code/trunk lofarsoft
    \endverbatim
    Once the checkout is complete, you will find a new directory \b lofarsoft
    with the following sub-structure:
    \verbatim
    lofarsoft
    |-- data
    |-- doc
    |-- release
    |-- build
    |-- devel_common
    |-- external
    `-- src
        `-- LASA
            |-- analysis
	    `-- test
    \endverbatim
    The source code is in \b src/LASA, while the compile and installation is done
    from \b build.

    <li>Set up your environment: Add the location of the new executables to your
    PATH variable:
    \verbatim
    # csh, tcsh
    setenv LOFARSOFT <root directory of code tree>
    source $LOFARSOFT/devel_common/scripts/init.csh

    # sh, bash
    export LOFARSOFT=<root directory of code tree>
    . $LOFARSOFT/devel_common/scripts/init.sh
    \endverbatim
    If you want this information to be persistent, you should add the setting to
    the configuration file of your shell; for bash users this is done in either
    $HOME/.profile or $HOME/.bashrc â€“ users of tcsh or csh need to add the 
    appropriate statement to $HOME/.cshrc. 
  </ol>

  <b>Compile the software</b>

  <ol>
    <li>Change into the \b build directory and run the \e bootstrap script:
    \verbatim
    cd build
    ./bootstrap
    \endverbatim
    The major job of the script is to check whether or not a recent version of
    CMake is available on your system; if this is not the case, CMake will be
    build from the provided sources and installed into \b release/bin (which 
    means that of course you should have that directory in your PATH).

    <li>Build the components  of the LASA software package:
    \verbatim
    make lasa
    \endverbatim
  </ol>
