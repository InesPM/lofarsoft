<ol>
  
  <li>As read-only access to the repository is not restricted in any ways,
  you can obtain a working copy of the source code by running
  
  <ul>
    <li>using <a href="http://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a>...
    <pre class="code">svn co http://usg.lofar.org/svn/code/trunk lofarsoft</pre>
    </li>
    <li>using <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>...
    <pre class="code">git svn clone http://usg.lofar.org/svn/code/trunk lofarsoft</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Once checkout from the repository is complete, first set up your environment:
  
  <pre class="code">
  # csh, tcsh
  setenv LOFARSOFT <root directory of code tree>
  source $LOFARSOFT/devel_common/scripts/init.csh
  
  # sh, bash
  export LOFARSOFT=<root directory of code tree>
  . $LOFARSOFT/devel_common/scripts/init.sh
  </pre>

  <li>Bootstrap your working copy of the software:
  <pre class="code">
  ./bootstrap
  </pre>
  The the main job of the bootstrap script is to check whether or not a recent
  enough version of <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> is
  installed on your system; if the found installation is too old or not
  available at all, a build from the provided sources is triggered and
  the resulting executables will be installed into "release/bin" (which
  of course then should be in your PATH).

  <li>Change into the <code>build</code> directory in order to build
  the software package you are interested in:
  <pre class="code">
  cd build
  make &lt;target&gt;
  </pre>
  In order to get a list of possible build targets, type
  <pre class="code">
  make help
  </pre>
</ol>

<h3>Directory hierarchy of the source code</h3>

Once the check-out is completed, you will find the following directory structure
on your disk:

<pre class='code'>

  <tr valign="top">
    <td><strong>devel_common</strong></td>
    <td>Directory holding common tools for development; this includes
      e.g. the find scripts for CMake or file templates for creating

    <td>Local version of the Doxygen-based source code documentation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">

<h3>Directory hierarchy of the release/installation directory</h3>

The installation location -- as defined through the
<tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt> variable by default is set to
<tt>LOFARSOFT/release</tt>; this will allow for local installation of
the User Software in case no system administration permissions are available.

<pre class='code'>
  lofarsoft
  |-- release
  |   |-- bin
  |   |-- include
  |   |-- lib
  |   |   `-- python
  |   `-- share
  |       |-- cmake
  |       |   `-- Modules
  |       `-- lus
  |           `-- doc
  |
</pre>

In this the sub-directories are used as follows:

<table border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><strong>bin</strong></td>
    <td>Installation destination for program executables (both
      compiled programs as well as scripts).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><strong>include</strong></td>
    <td>Installation destination of header files. Typically each
      individual package will collect its header files within a
      separate sub-directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><strong>lib</strong></td>
    <td>Installation destination for the library files. The
      <strong>python</strong> sub-directory holds shared libraries to
      be imported as modules into Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><strong>share</strong></td>
    <td>Installation destination for commonly shared files, such as
      <a href="#Documentation">documentation</a> (be it HTML-based of man-pages). The
      <strong>cmake</strong> sub-directory is utilized for the
      installation of custom CMake extension (such as the various
      search modules, which are not part of the standard CMake
      distribution).</td>

<div class='section'><a name="Packages">Collection of software packages</a></div>

The LOFAR User Software (LUS) collection includes the following
packages:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anaamika</strong> <br>
  This suite includes the following sets of programs :
  <ol>
    <li><i>Blob Detection and Source Measurement</i> (BDSM). f-BDSM is written in fortran 77 and is a prototype for the final Python based PyBDSM which is currently being developed. This has been tested on simulations and real data (including CS1) and the report of these tests can be found elsewhere. f-BDSM (latest version 2.0) is currently maintained by the author at Leiden. Though BDSM can be run from the command line, all the tasks inside this package are also available individually in the package noise . The automatised graphics-free executable is called bdsm.</li>
    <li><i>Noise</i>. This package works on images which can be read in from FITS files. Images can also be created inside the package using simple tasks. Various mathematical operations can then be performed on these images (basic statistics, image addition, median filtering etc, see below for the full list). They can also be displayed, with histograms, slice plots etc. Related to this package is Blob Detection and Source Measurement (BDSM), described in the previous chapter BDSM outputs a list of gaussians (and sources, and a residual image) given an input image. ‘Noise’ can then be used to overplot these gaussians on the image and analyse the products of BDSM. It can also be used to associate multiple source lists and analyse the associations (plot derived quantities against each other and overplot associated sources over the image etc).</li>
    <li><i>Optimized Global Sky Model</i> (OR GSM). This program
  (<code>or_gsm</code>) aims to construct a Global Sky Model (GSM)
  from a collection of sky catalogues, assumed to be at similar
  resolutions. A GSM is a model of the sky at a given resolution and
  frequency, in terms of discrete sources. This model is made by
  associating sources from the input catalogues. These GSM sources can
  be specified by a specific decomposition, e.g., gaussians or
  shapelets. Source properties are modelled as polynomial functions of
  frequency, though currently this option is only implemented for the
  total flux. Frequency spectra for each source are made available as
  a model as well as plots. A predicted GSM can be compared with an
  external catalogue as well.</li>
    <li><i>Analyse_island</i>. This is a standalone program which will later be incorporated into ANAAMIKA and is useful for inspecting the results of BDSM for an individual island.</li>
    <li><i>Qualitycontrol</i>. This is a prototype of a Quality
  Control package, and is strung together from bits and pieces in the
  package ANAAMIKA to form an automated command-line software.</li>
    <li><i>Simulation</i>. This is a fairly simple program to simulate
  the radio sky at low frequencies. Only single and double sources are
  incorporated currently. The need for upgrading the simulation to
  include extended sources is not foreseen, though.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pulsar-Tools</strong></li>
  <li><strong>PyCRTools</strong></li>
</ul>

<div class='section'><a name="Documentation">Documentation</a></div>

Aside some high-level documentation (such as provided through this
file), it also is possible to generate a source code documentation for
the individual packages included in the software
collection. Generation of this documentation is carried out using
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> and can be initiated from
the build directory via the command

<pre class="code">
make doc
</pre>

As already indicated above, the resulting HTML pages will be written
to <tt>share/lus/doc/html</tt> of the release/installation directory:

<pre class='code'>
  lofarsoft
  |-- release
  |   `-- share
  |       `-- lus
  |           `-- doc
  |               |-- html
  |               `-- latex
  |
</pre>

<div class="top">[<a href="#top">top</a>]</div>

<!-- New section --------------------------------------------------------------->

<div class='section'><a name="Testing">Testing</a></div>

<p align="justify">Given the number of targeted platforms and external
dependencies (see corresponding <a href="#External dependencies">section above</a>)
we are aiming to provide a framework through which it is possible to
test the behaviour of the software collection. While each of the
individual packages might bring along its own collection of tests, we
also need means to check the integration within the framework of the LUS.</p>

<pre class="code">
make DashboardBuild
</pre>

Test builds for the individual packages can be triggered via
<pre class="code">
make &lt;package&gt;_Experimental
</pre>

The results of the test will be submitted to the ASTRON Dashboard
server and displayed on the <a href="http://svn.astron.nl/CDash/index.php?project=LUSCommon">LUSCommon</a>
page.
