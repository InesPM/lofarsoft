>>> Build high-level packages

High-level build targets are available for a number of packages, which are build
on top of other external components:

  * [cr] CR-Tools
  * [dal] Data Access Library
  * [rm] Rotation Measure Synthesis 

Once completing the check-out of the source code from the USG repository, the
following steps are required:

  cd $LOFARSOFT/build
  ./bootstrap
  make <package>

So in order to e.g. build the DAL, run

  make dal

from within the "build" directory.

>>> Create Doxygen documentation

Create a local version of the documentation:

  ./bootstrap
  make doc

Point your web browser to

  $LOFARSOFT/doc/html/index.html

in order to read the documentation generated by Doxygen.
