NOTE:
	This file is used to help CMake to locate the default installation area,
	which is not e.g. /usr or /usr/local, but a directory below the root of the
	USG code tree. The motivation for this is, that without overriding this
	installation destination, all user software should end up in a well-defined
	and self-contained area, which -- if necessary -- could be easily removed
	from the system.
