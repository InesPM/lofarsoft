- Eliminate usage of numpy.core.ma, as it makes mask managements
  quite untransparent and unreliable

- Optimize python version of the fitting

- Implement C fitting: gsl fitters, minuit, fumili, netlib:opt:varpro, lmfit(numerical recipies)
  see SEAL/minuit for the minimization interface

- Investigate the possibility to use momenta analysis to speed up fitting.

- visualizers: fityk, veusz, hippodraw, qtiplot
