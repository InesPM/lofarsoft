# Release Dynspec ICD6 v-0.0.1
# By N.Vilchez on the 14/05/2012


Version 0.1 consists in a reader and a writter of 1 beam file from ICD3 pipeline. 

Beam files are obtained by ICD3 pipeline and, beams files are composed of 1 hdf5 file which contains the metadata and the link to the data file itself. 
Associated data files are ".raw" format. 

This version read metadatas using DAL library (developed at ASTRON) and stocks metadata in several variables.
Data is stocked in a matrix included in the output file. 

Currently, the code is composed of only one class object which read and write (in the right ICD6 format) the data in only one hdf5 file. 


Future Realeases: v-0.0.2 
will consists in separating the reader and the writter in 2 class objects and generate 2 object for stocking metadata and data. 
Finaly, the goal is to generate directly a hdf5 file for one observation including several dynamic spectrum.

Version 0.2 the same as V.0.1 about functionnalties

this version convert a ICD3 hdf5 file in ICD6 format
Differences are now in the code itself. 

Now, the code is composed of a main.cpp named Dynspec.cpp, and 4 objects which do the different tasks. 

Dynspec.cpp                     	=> Main file
         
Reader_Root.cpp				=> read in ICD3 hdf5 file all meta-data which will be include in the root group of the ICD6 file 
Stock_Write_Root_Metadata.cpp		=> write all root meta-data in the ICD6 file 

Reader_Dynspec.cpp  			=> read in ICD3 hdf5 file all meta-data which will be include in the root group of the ICD6 file 
Stock_Write_Dynspec_Metadata.cpp	=> write all dynspec meta-data in the ICD6 file and write the DATA table

Version 1.0 

Architecture of the code had not moved from v.0.2, we have the same objects with the same functionalities

The difference is now, all beams from an observation (one beam per styation+ summed beam with all stations) are included in the same ICD6
hdf5 file. 

To do that, I just had to implement a loop on each beam using C++ objects (Reader_Dynspec.cpp and Stock_Write_Dynspec_Metadata.cpp). 

We can notice, in ICD3 format, altought, beams are contained in different hdf5 files (and data in differents .raw), each station Beams 
(BEAM GROUP) have an index, and each sources (or target) have an index too (in SUBARRAY_POINTINGS GROUP). 


future Realease:
Next step will be to include in the same output ICD6 hdf5 file, all beams contained in a ICD3 folder, so observations with different 
sources, different Stockes parameters, different frequency bands, tiled dynamic spectrum generation.

Version 1.3 

All is done, ICD3 is converted to ICD6 format containing all metadata as mentioned in ICD6 Document. 

Dataset is generated as a 3D data Cube (time, frequency and Stokes for the third dimension)

For reading and generating voluminous dataset, we proceed step by step using a fixed quantity of memory (RAM) which can be 
fixed by the user himself. 


future Realease:
Finaly, we change the philosophy for a 2.0 version. Each SubArrayPointings from an ICD3 observation will generate ONE ICD6 file. 
So for an observation which contains 3 SAP, we will obtain after processing 3 ICD6 hdf5 files. 
In addition we separate this code in 2 codes: the first one named "DynspecAll" will convert all the ICD3 data and the second "DynspecQuick"
will allow to do a time and spectral selection and rebinning. This second tool will be very useful for genetrating lighter files allowing 
easy quicklook.
