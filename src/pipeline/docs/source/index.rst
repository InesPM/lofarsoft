This document provides a brief overview of the so-called "pipeline framework"
developed for supporting LOFAR pipelines, and describes how it has been used
to assemble a prototype "standard imaging pipeline".


The LOFAR Pipeline Framework
============================

The framework aims to make it possible to manage a variety of different
processing steps in a flexible yet consistent way, while running them in
parallel across the LOFAR offline cluster. The following chapters describe the
various components of the framework and how they fit together.
