The Standard Imaging Pipeline
*****************************

The Standard Imaging Pipeline (or SIP) will accept raw data from the LOFAR
correlator, pre-process it, calibrate it, image it, and update the sky model
with the sources detected in the data. This section describes the components
of the SIP and how they fit together.
