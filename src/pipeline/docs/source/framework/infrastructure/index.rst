Infrastructure and Setup

This section describes how to set up and start using the pipeline system. We
start with a quick-start guide for using the pipeline framework on the LOFAR
CEP cluster: this is designed to enable users to get up and running as quickly
as possible.

The following sections describe in more detail how to install and use the
pipeline framework on any other system.

One of the major aims in the design of the pipeline system is to require as
little run-specific configuration as possible. In other words, we rely on
convention and sensible defaults wherever possible. This section describes
the standards that our pipeline system will rely on.
