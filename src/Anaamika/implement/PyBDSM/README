Originally, this dir had 
 |
 |--- port3
 |
 |--- minpack
 |
 |--- bdsm python modules
 |
 |--- all the c++ and .h files here itself

Now, the c++ and their .h files are in the directory c++ and the python stuff are in the dir python. 

Hence the CMakeLists file here needs to be modified for that.

We also need to create _pytesselate.so and _py2fbdsm.so and the fortran files for these r now in ../fBDSM/wout_pgplot/
