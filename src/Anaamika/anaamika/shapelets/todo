the sigma level for formisland_rank shud depend on peak snr and fw. for decent snr, low nsig
adds too much noise pixels and hence increases chisq. 3 seems ok. for small fw for eg
u need more pixels so 2 sigma seems ok.

fitgauss dowsnt work for very small not very strong sources as moment2 is wrong. 
becos it takes huge area
to compute. becoz my island algo isnt there and i just take 3 sigma out to entire image. need
a prelim island algo !!

shapelet can have diff beta in diff directions ???

elliptical gaussians ?????  rotate and then apply previous ??? 

shapelet fits noise. so ignore components which have power like noise rms ?
