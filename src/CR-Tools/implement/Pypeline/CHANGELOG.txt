- added global function trackHistory(bool) - to switch history
tracking in arrays on or off

2010-06-07 - Heino Falcke  - rev 5057:
- changed downsample routines to work with fractional block sizes
- changed RFI routines to check for too large number of bins (so
smaller blocksizes will also work)
 
2010-06-01:  
- added convenience function hInvFFTwSave to do a save fft (hftools.cc, testcr2.py)
- added hMinPos, hMaxPos - returning position of maxium or minimum (hftools.cc,testcr2.py)
- added calculation of time delays with cross-correlation from CR data (testcr2.py)
- remaining: some not-understood behaviour of invfftw
