2010-06-07 - Heino Falcke  - rev 5064:
- added global function trackHistory(bool) - to switch history
tracking in arrays on or off

2010-06-07 - Heino Falcke  - rev 5057:
- changed downsample routines to work with fractional block sizes
- changed RFI routines to check for too large number of bins (so
smaller blocksizes will also work)
 
2010-06-01:  
- added convenience function hInvFFTwSave to do a save fft (hftools.cc, testcr2.py)
- added hMinPos, hMaxPos - returning position of maxium or minimum (hftools.cc,testcr2.py)
- added calculation of time delays with cross-correlation from CR data (testcr2.py)
- remaining: some not-understood behaviour of invfftw

2010-08-25 - Heino Falcke:
- changed hFileRead to accept iterate input and hence to read data
into the array starting at any location

2010-08-26 - Heino Falcke - rev 5751:
- added hMulAdd2 which will loop over the second rather than the 1st
parameter in looping mode

2010-08-26 - Heino Falcke - rev 5765:
- added hFlip to reverse the order of elements in a vector

2010-08-26 - Sander ter Veen - rev 5836 +
- Corrected hMulAdd2
- Added IO and calibration module
- Added pipeline_start.py script for the first basic steps using these
modules

2010-11-03 - Heino Falcke - rev 6228
- Added hTranspose - to transpose a vector on the c++ level
- adapted hArray_tranpose to use hTranspose with hArrays
- Added Functions hDiffSum and hDiffSquaredSum to caluclate the (sum
of the (squared)) differences of two vectors
- changed hFill to allow filling one vector with a second vector of
different type
- hArrays can now be created with a copy from another vector of
different type (use the "copy=other_array"  or  "fill=other_array" keywords)
- added hDoubleFFT, hDoubleFFTPhase, hDoubleFFTPhaseMul to do a double
FFT based on Arthur's numpy example
- testDoubleFFT.py shows an example testing the douple FFT
- created a separate plot.py module in core, as this was not working
properly in the new structure
- moved the list of hftools function to be added as methods to harrays
and vectors to  type.py
