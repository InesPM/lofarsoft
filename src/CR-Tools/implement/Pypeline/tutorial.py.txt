1.  StartUp
-----------

First one needs to load the library. This can be done by "from hftools
import *" which makes all the c++ functions and their python wrappers
available.

In addition there are some helpful definitons in python as well, which
are stored in "pycrtools.py". This file actually imports hftools for
you. Hence, all you actually need to do is (make sure the file is in
your search path)

>>> from pycrtools import *

The most convenient way is probably to define an alias in your .bashr
or .profile files, like

alias pycr='/sw/bin/python2.6 -i $LOFARSOFT/src/CR-Tools/implement/Pypeline/pycrinit.py'

then you can simply start the pyrtools with 'pycr'.

The file pycrinit.py also allows you to read in a second file to be
executed, like this one here. So, you can run the tutorial with

pycr -i tutorial.py

from the UNIX prompt.


2.  Getting Help
================

The pycrtools have a built-in help system, which can be accessed with:

>>> help()

To get information on a specific function or method type
help(func). This will essentially print the docstring of the python
object and list all its methods. Hence, help will work on any decently
implemented python object, including the standard ones.

For example,

>>> help(IntVec)

will give documentation on the integer vector, while

>>> help(IntVec.sin)

will give the documentation on the "sin" method associated with it.

For a listing of all available functions in the pycrtools type

>>> help(all).


3.  Vectors
===========

3.1.  Some Basics
-----------

The fundamental data structure we use is a standard c++ vector defined
in the c++ standard template library (STL). This is wrapped and
exposed to python using the Boost Python system.

(NB: Unfortunately different systems provide different python data
structures. Hence a function exposed to python with SWIG or SIP is not
diretcly able to accept a BOOST PYTHON wrapped vector as input or vice
versa. If you want to do this you have to provide extra conversion
routines.)

In line with the basic python philosophy, vectors are passed as
references. Since we are working with large sets of data processing
time is as important as convenience. Hence the basic principle is that
we try to avoid copying large chunks of data as much as possible.

The basic functions operating on the data in c++ either take STL
iterators as inputs (i.e. pointers to the begin and end of the memory
where the data in the STL vector is stored) or casa::Vectors, which
are created with shared memory (i.e. their physical memory is the same
as that of the STL vector).

For that reason MEMORY ALLOCATION is done almost exculsively in the
Python layer. The fast majority of c++ functions is not even able to
allocate or free any memory. This allows for very efficient memory
management and processing, but also means that the user is responsible
for providing properly sized vectors as inputs AND output
vectors. I.e.: you need to know beforehand what sized vector you
expect in return!

That may be annoying, but forces you to think carefully about how to
use memory. For example, if there is a processing done multiple times
using a scratch vector of fixed size, you reuse the same vector over
and over again, thus avoiding a lot of unnecessary allocation and
deallocation of memory and creation of vectors.

Also, the basic vectors are inherently one-dimensional and not
multi-dimensional. On the other hand, multi-dimensional data is always
simply written sequentially into the memory - you just need to know
(and think about) how your data is organized. Some rudimentary support
for multi-dimensions has been added (if the data you need is
contiguous), but needs further work (see setDim, getDim, elem).

3.2.  Construction of STL Vectors
--------------------------------

A number of vector types are provided: bool, int, float, complex, and
str.

To creat a vector most efficently, use the original vector constructors:

- BoolVec()
- IntVec()
- FloatVec() 
- ComplexVec() 
- StringVec()

e.g.

>>> v=FloatVec(); v
  Vec(float,0)=[]

will create a floating point vector of size 0. 

The vector can be filled with a python list or tuple, by using the extend attribute:

>>> v.extend([1,2,3,4])

    v => Vec(float,4)=[1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0]

Note, that python has automatically converted the integers into
floats, since the STL vector does not allow any automatic typing.

The STL vector can be converted back to a python list by using the
python list creator:

    list(v) => [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

or use the list or val methods of the vector (where the latter has the
extra twist that it will return a scalar value, if the vector has a
length of one).

    v.val() => [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    v.list() => [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

However, the basic Boost Python STL vector constructor takes no
arguments and is a bit cumbersome to use in the long run.  Here we
provide a wrapper function that is useful for interactive use.  

Usage:

Vector(Type) -  will create an empty vector of type "Type", where Type is
a basic Python type, i.e.  bool, int, float, complex, str.

Vector(Type,size) - will create an vector of type "Type", with length "size".

Vector(Type,size,fill) - will create an vector of type "Type", with length
"size" and initialized with the value "fill"

Vector([1,2,3,...]) or Vector((1,2,3,...)) - if a list or a tuple is
provided as first argument then a vector is created of the type of the
first element in the list or tuple (here an integer) and filled with
the contents of the list or tuple.

So, what we will now use is:

>>> v=Vector([1.,2,3,4]); v
  Vec(4)=[1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0]

Note, that size and fill take precedence over the list and tuple
input. Hence if you create a vector with Vector([1,2,3],size=2) it
will contain only [1,2]. Vector([1,2,3],size=2,fill=4) will give
[4,4].

Some simple support for multiple dimensions had been implemented,
using the methods:

vector.setDim([n1,n2,..])
vector.getDim()
vector.elem(n)

However, this is already depreciated, since there is an array class to
do this better.


3.2.1.  Referencing, memory allocation, indexing, slicing
........................................................

Following basic python rules, the STL vector will persist in memory as
long as there is a python reference to it. If you destroy v also the
c++ memory will disappear. Hence, if you keep a pointer to the vector
in c++ and try to work on it after the python object was destroyed,
your programme may crash. That's why by default memory management is
done ONLY on one side, namely the python side!

To illustrate how Python deals with references, consider the following
example:

>>> x=v
>>> x[0]=3
>>> v
  Vec(4)=[3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0]

Hence, the new python object x is actually a reference to the same c++
vector that was created in v. Modifying elements in x modifies
elements in v. If you destroy v or x, the vector will not be
destroyed, since there is still a reference to it left. Only if you
destroy x and v the memory will be freed.


As note above, this vector is subscriptable and sliceable, using the
standard python syntax.

>>> v[1:3]
  Vec(2)=[2.0,3.0]

We can also resize vectors and change their memory allocation:

>>> v1=Vector([0.0,1,2,3,4,5]);v1
  Vec(float,6)=[0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,...]
>>> v2=Vector(float,len(v1),2.0);v2
  Vec(float,6)=[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,...]

With the resize attribute you allocate new memory while keeping the
data. It is not guaranteed that the new memory actually occupies the
same physical space.

>>> v2.resize(8);
>>> v2
  Vec(float,8)=[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,...]

Resize a vector and fill with non-zero values:

>>> v2.resize(10,-1)
>>> v2
  Vec(float,10)=[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,...]

Resize a vector to same size as another vector:

>>> v2.resize(v1)
>>> v2
  Vec(float,6)=[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,...]

Make a new vector of same size and type as the original one:

>>> v3=v2.new()
>>> v3
  Vec(float,6)=[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,...]

Fill a vector with values

>>> v3.fill(-2)
>>> v3
  Vec(float,6)=[-2.0,-2.0,-2.0,-2.0,-2.0,...]

3.2.2.  Vector arithmetic
........................................................

The vectors have a number of mathematical functions attached to
them. A full list can be seen by typing

>>> dir(v1)
  ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dict__', '__div__', '__doc__', '__format__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__idiv__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__instance_size__', '__isub__', '__iter__', '__len__', '__module__', '__mul__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'abs', 'acos', 'add', 'addadd', 'append', 'asin', 'atan', 'ceil', 'convert', 'copy', 'cos', 'cosh', 'countgreaterequal', 'countgreaterequalabs', 'countgreaterthan', 'countgreaterthanabs', 'countlessequal', 'countlessequalabs', 'countlessthan', 'countlessthanabs', 'dimension', 'div', 'divadd', 'downsample', 'elem', 'exp', 'extend', 'extendflat', 'fft', 'fill', 'fillrange', 'findgreaterequal', 'findgreaterequalabs', 'findgreaterthan', 'findgreaterthanabs', 'findlessequal', 'findlessequalabs', 'findlessthan', 'findlessthanabs', 'findlowerbound', 'floor', 'getDim', 'list', 'log', 'log10', 'mean', 'median', 'mul', 'muladd', 'mulsum', 'ndim', 'negate', 'new', 'norm', 'normalize', 'random', 'resize', 'setDim', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sort', 'sortmedian', 'sqrt', 'square', 'stddev', 'sub', 'subadd', 'sum', 'tan', 'tanh', 'type', 'val', 'vec']

Some of the basic arithmetic is available in an intuitve way.

You can add a scalar to a vector by

>>> v1+3
  Vec(float,6)=[3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,...]

This will actually create a new vector (and destroy it right away,
since no reference was kept). The original vector is unchanged.

A technical limitiation is that - even though addition and
multiplication is cummutative, the scalar (i.e., non-vector) values
has to come as the second argument.

You can also add two vectors (which is commutative):

>>> v1+v2
  Vec(float,6)=[2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,...]

In order to change the vector, you can use the "in place" operators
+=, -=, /=, *= :

Adding a vector in place:

>>> v1+=v2
    v1 => Vec(float,6)=[2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,...]

now v1 was actually modified such that v2 was added to the content of
v1 and the results is stored in v1.

Similarly you can do

- v1-=v2
- v1*=v2
- v1/=v2

Here are examples of some basic statistics functions one can use

Mean: 

    v1.mean() => 4.5

Median:

    v1.median() => 5.0

Summing all elements in a vector: 

    v1.sum() => 27.0

Standard Deviation:

    v1.stddev() => 1.87082869339

3.3.  Working with the hArray class
----------------------------------

3.3.1.  Creating Arrays and basic operations
..........................................

While the basic underlying data structures are plain STL vectors, in
many cases, however, one has to deal with multi-dimensional data. For
this case we introduce a new wrapper class, named hArrays, that
mimicks a multi-dimensional array, but still operates on an underlying
vector with essentially a flat, horizontal data structure. Given that
a major concern is to minimize duplication of large data structures,
the array class will share memory with its associated vector and also
with arrays that are derived from it. Explicit copying will have to be
done in order to avoid this. Access to various dimensions (rows,
columns, etc...) is done via slices that need to be contiguous in
memory! Since the array is vector-based, all methods defined for
vectors are also inherited by hArrays and can be applied to slices or
even automatically loop over multiple slices (e.g., rows or columns).

An array is defined using the hArray function. This is a constructor
function and not a class of its own. It will return array classes of
different types, such as IntArray, FloatArray, ComplexArray,
StringArray, BoolArray, referring to the different data types they
contain. As for vectors, each array can only contain one type of data.

hArray(Type=float,dimensions=[n1,n2,n3...],fill=None) -> FloatArray

where Type can be a Python type, a Python list/tuple (where the first
element determines the type), an STL vector, or another hArray.

Dimensions are given as a list of the form [dim1,dim2,dim3, ...]. The
size of the underlying vector will automatically be resized to
dim1*dim2*dim3* ... to be able to contain all elements. Alternatively,
one can provide another array, who's dimensions will be copied.

The array can be filled with an initialization values that can be
either a single value, a list, a tuple, or an STL vector of the same
type.

>>> v=Vector(range(10))

>>> a=hArray(v,[3,3])

    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

One may wonder what the representation of the Array actually
means. 

a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,5,0,0,0]

After "hArray(" first the data type is given, then the array
dimensions and total vector size, and finally the currently active
slice (given as start and end index of the vector). An optional
asterisk indicates that the next operation will actually loop the
previously specified slices (see below). At the end the currently
selected slice is displayed (while the array may actually hold more
data).

The underlying vector of an array can be retrieved with the .vec()
method. I.e.,

>>> a.vec()
  Vec(int,9)=[0,1,2,3,4,...]

The arrays have most of the vector methods defined, so you can also
add, multiply, etc. with scalars or other arrays.

    a*2 => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,2,4,6,8,...]

    a*a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,4,9,16,...]

Underlying these operations are the basic hftools functions, e.g. the
multiplication is essentially a python method that first creates a new
array and then calls hMul.

>>> tmp_array=a.new()
>>> tmp_array.mul(a,2)

    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

BTW, this could also be done calling the function hMul(tmp_array,a,2),
rather than the corresponding method. 

An important constraint is that all these functions or methods only
work with either vector or array clases, a mix in the paramters
between vectors and arrays is currently not supported.

3.3.2.  Changing Dimensions
..........................

The dimensions can be obtained and set, using the getDim and setDim
methods. If the length of the underlying vector changes due to a
change in the dimensions, the vector will be resized and padded with
zeros, if necessary.

>>> a.getDim()
  [3, 3]

>>> a.setDim([3,3,2])
  hArray(int, [3, 3, 2]=18, [0:18]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

>>> a.setDim([3,3])
  hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

3.3.3.  Memory sharing
......................

Note, that the array and vector point share the same memory. Changing
an element in the vector

>>> v[0]=-1

    v => Vec(int,9)=[-1,1,2,3,4,...]
    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [-1,1,2,3,4,...]

will also change the corresponding element in the array. The same is,
btw, true if one creates an array from an array. Both will share the
same underlying data vector. They will, btw, also share the same size
and dimensions.

>>> b=hArray(a)

>>> b[0,0]=-2

    b => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [-2,1,2,3,4,...]
    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [-2,1,2,3,4,...]
    v => Vec(int,9)=[-2,1,2,3,4,...]

>>> v[0]=0

    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

To actually make a pyhsically distinct copy, you need to explicitly
copy the data over.

>>> c=hArray(int,a)

>>> a.copy(c)

or more simply

>>> c=hArray(int,a,a)

(the 2nd parameter is for the dimensions, the third one is the fill
parameter that initates the copying).

3.3.4.  Basic Slicing
...................

The main purpose of these arrays is, of course, to be able to access
multiple dimensions. This is done using the usual __getitem__ method
of python.

Let us take our two-dimensional array from before:

    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

The vector followed by a single number in square brackets 
will "in principle" obtain the first column of the array.

    a[0] => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:3]) -> [0,1,2]

It says "in principle", because the only thing which that command does is
to return a new hArray python object, which will point to the same
data vector, but contain a different data slice which is then returned
whenever a method tries to operate on the vector.

>>> a[0].vec()
  Vec(int,3)=[0,1,2]

This retrieves a copy of the data, since assigning a sub-slice of a
vector to another vector actually requires copying the data - as
vectors do not know about slicing (yet). Use one-dimensional arrays if
you want to have are reference to a slice only.

In contrast, a.vec(), without slicing, will give you a reference to
the underlying vector.

Similarly, 

>>> a[0,1].vec()
  Vec(int,1)=[1]

will access a slice consisting of a single element (returned as a
vector). To obtain it as a scalar value, use

>>> a[0,1].val()
  1

One may wonder, why one has to use the extra methods vec and val to
access the data. The reason is that slicing on its own will return an
array (and not a vector), which we need for other purposes still.

Slicing can also be done over multiple elements of one dimension,
using the known python slicing syntax:

>>> a[0,0:2].val()
  [0, 1]

however, currently this is restricted to the last dimension only, in
order to point to a contiguous memory slice. Hence:

>>> a[0:2]
  hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:6]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

is possible, but not

>>> a[0:2,0:2]
  hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:2]) -> [0,1]

where the first slice is simply ignored.

3.3.5.  Applying Methods to Slices
................................

First, of all, we can now apply the known vector functions also to
array slices directly. E.g.,

>>> a[0].sum()
  Vec(int,1)=[3]

will return the sum over the first row of the array, i.e. the first
three elements of the underlying vector. While 

>>> a[0].negate()
    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,-1,-2,3,4,...]
>>> a[0].negate()
    a => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

returns nothing, but will actually change ths sign of the first three
elements in the underlying vector.

In principle one could now loop over all slices using a for loop:

>>> for i in range(a.getDim()[0]): print "Row",i,":",a[i].val(), " => a =", a
  Row 0 : [0, 1, 2]  => a = hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]
  Row 1 : [3, 4, 5]  => a = hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]
  Row 2 : [6, 7, 8]  => a = hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

However, looping over slices in simple way is aready built into the
arrays, by appending the Ellipsis symbol "..." to the dimensions. This
will actually put the array in "looping mode".

>>> l=a[0:3,...]
    l => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:3]*) -> [0,1,2]

which is indicated in the screen representation of the array by an
extra asterisk and actually means that one can loop over all the
elements of the respective dimension.

>>> iterate=True
>>> while iterate:
...     print "Row",l.loop_nslice(),":",l.val(), " => l =", l
...     iterate=l.next().doLoopAgain()
  Row 0 : [0, 1, 2]  => l = hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:3]*) -> [0,1,2]
  Row 1 : [3, 4, 5]  => l = hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [3:6]*) -> [3,4,5]
  Row 2 : [6, 7, 8]  => l = hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [6:9]*) -> [6,7,8]

    l => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:3]*) -> [0,1,2]

This will do exactly the same as the for-loop above.

Here doLoopAgain() will return True as long as the array is in looping
mode and has not yet reached the last slice. loop_nslice() returns the
current slice the array is set to (see also loop_i, loop_start,
loop_end). next() will advance to the next slice until the end is
reached (and doLoopAgain is set to false). The loop will be reset at
the next call of next(). Hence, as written above the loop could be
called multiple times where the loop will be automatically reset each
time.

We could also explicitly reset the loop in using to its starting
values, but that should not be necessary most of the time.

>>> l.resetLoop()
  hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:3]*) -> [0,1,2]

Now, since this is still a bit too much work, you can actually apply
(most of) the available vector methods to multiple slices at once, by
just applying it to an array in looping mode.

As an example, let's calculate the mean value of each slice at the to
level of our example array, which is simply:

>>> l.mean()
  Vec(float,3)=[1.0,4.0,7.0]

In contrast to the same method applied to vectors, where a single
value is returned, the return value is now a vector of values, each of
which corresponds to the mean of one top-level slice. Hence, the
vector has looped automatically over all the slices specified in the
definition of the array.

The looping over slices can be more complex taking start, stop, and
increment values into account:

>>> a[1:,...].mean()
  Vec(float,2)=[4.0,7.0]

will loop over all top-level slices starting at the 2nd slice 
(slice #1) until the last.

>>> a[:2,...].mean()
  Vec(float,2)=[1.0,4.0]

will loop over the first two top-level slices.

>>> a[0:3:2,...].mean()
  Vec(float,2)=[1.0,7.0]

will loop over the two top-level slices using an increment of 2,
i.e. here take the first and third only (so, here non contiguous
slices can be put to work).

To loop over all slices in one dimensions, a short-cut can be used by
leaving away the slice specification. Hence,

>>> a[...].mean()
  Vec(float,3)=[1.0,4.0,7.0]

will do the same as a[0:,..].mean().

Finally, it is even possible to specify an array of indices for the slicing. 

>>> a[[0,2],...].mean()
  Vec(float,2)=[1.0,7.0]

will loop over slices 0 and 2.


Looping can also be done for methods that require multiple arrays as
inputs (remember a mix of vectors and arrays is not implemented). In this
case the next() method will be applied to every array in the paramter
list and looping proceeds until the first array has reached the
end. Hence, care has to be taken that the same slice looping is
applied to all arrays in the parameter list.

As an example we create a new array of the dimensions of a

>>> x=hArray(int,a)

and fill it with slices from "a" multiplied by the scalar value 2

>>> x[[0,2],...].mul(a[[0,2],...],2)

    x => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,2,4,0,0,...]

and indeed now the first and last slice were operated on and filled
with the results of the operation.

Forgetting slicing in a parameter can lead to unexpected results,
e.g., in the following example "a" is looped over but x is not. Hence,
the result will always be written (and overwritten) into the first
three elements of x, containing at the end only the results of the
mutliplication of the last slice in a.
>>> x.fill(0); x[...].mul(a,2)

    x => hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,2,4,0,2,...]

3.3.6.  Units and Scale Factors
................................

Numerical arrays allow one to set a (single) unit for the data. With
setUnit(prefix, unit_name) one can specify the name of the unit and
the scale factor, which is specified as a string being one of
"f","p","n","micro","m","c","d","","h","k","M","G","T","P","E","Z".

>>> a.setUnit("M","Hz")
  hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1,2,3,4,...]

will set the unitname to MHz without modifiying the values in the
array (assuming that the values were deliverd initially in this
unit). However, the scaling can be changed by calling setUnit again
(with or without a unit name), e.g.:

>>> a.setUnit("k","")
  hArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1000,2000,3000,4000,...]

Which has converted the values to kHz.  The name of the unit can be
retrieved with

>>> a.getUnit()
  'kHz'

and cleared with clearUnit().

3.3.7.  Keywords and Values
................................

For documenting the vector further and to store certain values, one
can store keywords and values in the array. This is done with

>>> a.setKey("name","TestArray")
  TestArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1000,2000,3000,4000,...]

The keywords can be arbitrary strings ann the values also arbirtrary
strings. Thus numbers need to be converted to strings and back. The
keyword "name" is special in the sense that it is a default key, that
is recognized by a number of other modules (including the __repr__
method governing array output) to briefly describe the data.

The keyword values can be retrieved using getKey:

>>> a.getKey("name")
  'TestArray'

3.3.8.  History Logbook
................................

The array keeps a history of most operations performed with it. This
can be viewed by using the getHistory (retrieves a vector of strings)
or simply the .history() method, which prints the activity log.

>>> a.history()
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [initialize_storage]: Vector of type St6vectorIiSaIiEE created.
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [delVector]: Vector of typeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE and size=0 deleted.
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [initialize_storage]: Vector of type St6vectorIiSaIiEE created.
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [setDimension]: Dimensions set to [10]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [setDimension]: Dimensions set to [3,3]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [setDimension]: Dimensions set to [3,3,2]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [setDimension]: Dimensions set to [3,3]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hFill]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [-1,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hFill]:   Par 1: fill_value = -2
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hCopy]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hCopy]:   Par 1: outvec = array[T,9] : [0,0,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hSum]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hNegate]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hNegate]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,-1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hMean]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hMean]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hMean]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hMean]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hMean]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [hMean]:   Par 0: vec = array[T,9] : [0,1,...]
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [setUnit]: Unit set to MHz.
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [setUnit]: Unit set to kHz.
    2010-04-02 01:00:57 [setKey]: name = TestArray

You can add a line to the history log yourself with 

>>> a.addHistory("TEST","This is a test.")
  TestArray(int, [3, 3]=9, [0:9]) -> [0,1000,2000,3000,4000,...]

and clear the entire log with .clearHistory().

History tracking can be switched off with 

>>> a.setHistory(False)

4.  File I/O
------------

4.1.  Opening and Closing a CR Data File
---------------------------------------

Let's see how we can open a file. First define a filename, e.g.:

>>> filename_sun=LOFARSOFT+"/data/lopes/example.event"
>>> filename_lofar_big=LOFARSOFT+"/data/lofar/rw_20080701_162002_0109.h5"
>>> filename_lofar=LOFARSOFT+"/data/lofar/trigger-2010-02-11/triggered-pulse-2010-02-11-TBB1.h5"

    filename_sun => /Users/falcke/LOFAR/usg/data/lopes/example.event
    filename_lofar_big => /Users/falcke/LOFAR/usg/data/lofar/rw_20080701_162002_0109.h5
    filename_lofar => /Users/falcke/LOFAR/usg/data/lofar/trigger-2010-02-11/triggered-pulse-2010-02-11-TBB1.h5

We can create a new file object, using the "crfile" class, which is an
interface to the LOFAR CRTOOLS datareader class and was defined in pycrtools.py. 

The following will open a data file and return a DataReader object:

>>> datafile=crfile(filename_lofar).set("blocksize",1024*2)

The associated filename can be retrieved with

>>> datafile.filename
  '/Users/falcke/LOFAR/usg/data/lofar/trigger-2010-02-11/triggered-pulse-2010-02-11-TBB1.h5'

The file will be automatically closed (and the DataReader object be
destroyed), whenever the crfile object is deleted, e.g. with "file=0".


4.2.  Setting and retrieving metadata (parameters)
-------------------------------------------------

Now we need to access the meta data in the file. This is can be done
in multiple ways. One way is by using the get method. This method
actually calls the function "hFileGetParameter" defined in the c++
code.

Which observatory did we actually use?

>>> obsname=datafile.get("observatory");
    obsname => LOFAR

There are more keywords, of course. A list of implemented parameters
we can access is obtained by

>>> keywords=datafile.get("help")
  hFileGetParameter - available keywords: nofAntennas, nofSelectedChannels, nofSelectedAntennas, nofBaselines, block, blocksize, stride, fftLength, nyquistZone, sampleInterval, referenceTime, sampleFrequency, antennas, selectedAntennas, selectedChannels, positions, increment, frequencyValues, frequencyRange, Date, Observatory, Filesize, presync, TL, LTL, EventClass, SampleFreq, StartSample, AntennaIDs, keywords, help

Note, that the results are returned as PythonObjects. Hence, this
makes use of the power of python with automatic typing. For, example

>>> datafile.get("frequencyRange")
  Vec(float,2)=[0.0,100000000.0]

actually returns a vector. 

Here no difference is made where the data comes from. The keyword
Obervatory accesses the header record in the data file while the
frequencRange accesses a method of the DataReader.

A second way do retreive data is to use square brackets, since
datafile[key] is equivalent to datafile.get(key).

>>> datafile["blocksize"]
  2048

Just for fun let's define a number of variables that contain essential
parameters (we will later actually use different ones which are
automatically stored in the datafile object).

>>> obsdate   =datafile["Date"] 
>>> filesize  =datafile["Filesize"]
>>> blocksize =datafile["blocksize"] 
>>> nAntennas =datafile["nofAntennas"] 
>>> antennas  =datafile["antennas"] 
>>> antennaIDs=datafile["AntennaIDs"] 
>>> selectedAntennas=datafile["selectedAntennas"]
>>> nofSelectedAntennas=datafile["nofSelectedAntennas"] 
>>> fftlength =datafile["fftLength"]
>>> sampleFrequency =datafile["sampleFrequency"]
>>> maxblocksize=min(filesize,1024*1024); 
>>> nBlocks=filesize/blocksize; 

    obsdate => 1265926154
    filesize => 132096
    blocksize => 2048
    nAntennas => 16
    antennas => Vec(int,16)=[0,1,2,3,4,...]
    antennaIDs => Vec(int,0)=[]
    selectedAntennas => Vec(int,16)=[0,1,2,3,4,...]
    nofSelectedAntennas => 16
    fftlength => 1025
    sampleFrequency => 200000000.0
    maxblocksize => 132096
    nBlocks => 64

To get a readable version of the observing date use the python time module

>>> import time
    time.asctime(time.localtime(obsdate)) => Thu Feb 11 23:09:14 2010

Luckily, you do not have to do this all the time, since all the
parameters will be read out at the beginning and will be stored as
attributes to the file object.

>>> for kw in datafile.keywords: p_("datafile."+kw)
    datafile.observatory => LOFAR
    datafile.blocksize => 2048
    datafile.antennaIDs => Vec(int,0)=[]
    datafile.nyquistZone => 1
    datafile.antennas => Vec(int,16)=[0,1,2,3,4,...]
    datafile.nofBaselines => 120
    datafile.filesize => 132096
    datafile.increment => Vec(float,2)=[5e-09,97656.25]
    datafile.selectedAntennas => Vec(int,16)=[0,1,2,3,4,...]
    datafile.selectedChannels => Vec(int,1025)=[0,1,2,3,4,...]
    datafile.nofAntennas => 16
    datafile.sampleFrequency => 200000000.0
    datafile.nofSelectedAntennas => 16
    datafile.referenceTime => 0.0
    datafile.frequencyValues => Vec(float,1025)=[0.0,97656.25,195312.5,292968.75,390625.0,...]
    datafile.nofSelectedChannels => 1025
    datafile.stride => 0
    datafile.sampleInterval => 5e-09
    datafile.frequencyRange => Vec(float,2)=[0.0,100000000.0]
    datafile.fftLength => 1025
    datafile.date => 1265926154
    datafile.block => 0

They will be updated whenever you do a file.set(key,value), however,
assigning a new value to the attribute will NOT automatically change
the parameter in the file. For this, you have to use the the "set"
method, which is an implementation of the "hFileSetParameter"
function. E.g. changing the blocksize we already did before. This is
simply

>>> datafile.set("blocksize",2048);

again the list of implemented keywords is visible with using

>>> datafile.set("help",0);

Here the listed keywords actually start with capital letters, however,
to spare you some annoyance, you can use a spelling which starts with
either an upper or a lower case letter.

Another useful feature: The set method actually returns the crfile
object itself. Hence, you can append multiple set commands after each
other.

>>> datafile.set("block",2).set("selectedAntennas",[0,2,3]);

Alternatively you can also use square brackets:

>>> datafile["selectedAntennas"]=[0,2]

but then it is not possible to append multiple set commands in one
line, so you need to provide lists of keywords and list of values, like

>>> datafile["blocksize","selectedAntennas"]=[2048,[0,2]]

>>> datafile["blocksize","selectedAntennas"]
  [2048, Vec(int,2)=[0,2]]

Note, that we have now reduced the number of antennas to two: namely
antenna 0 and 2 and the number of selected antennas is

>>> datafile["nofSelectedAntennas"]
  2

However, in the follwing we want to work on all antennas again, so we
do

>>> datafile.set("block",0).set("selectedAntennas",range(nAntennas))


4.3.  Reading in Data
---------------------

The next step is to actually read in data. This is done with the read
method (accessing "hFileRead"). The data is read flatly into a 1D
vector. This is also true if mutliple antennas are read out at
once. Here simply the data from the antennas follow each other.

Also, by default memory allocation of the vectors has to be done in
python before calling any of the functions. This improves speed and
efficiency, but requires one to programme carefully and to understand
the data structrue.

First we create a FloatArray of the correct dimensions, naming it
Voltage and setting the Unit to counts.

>>> fxdata=hArray(float,[nofSelectedAntennas,blocksize],name="E-Field").setUnit("","Counts")

This is now a large vector filled with zeros.

Now we can read in the raw time series data, either using
"datafile.read" and a keyword, or actually better, use the read method
of arrays, as they then store filename and history information in the
array.


Currently implemented keywords for reading data fields are: "Fx",
"Voltage", "FFT", "CalFFT","Time", "Frequency" (and "TimeLag").

So, let us read in the raw time series data, i.e. the electric field
in the antenna as digitized by the ADC. This is provided by the
keyword "Fx" (means f(x) ).

>>> fxdata.read(datafile,"Fx")
    fxdata => E-Field(float, [16, 2048]=32768, [0:32768]) -> [16.0,17.0,10.0,18.0,17.0,...]

and voila the vector is filled with time series data from the data
file. Note that we had to use the .vec method for the array, since
datafile.read does not yet accept arrays (since it can't handle c++
iterators).

Now, you can access the individual antennas as single vectors through
slicing

>>> ant0data=fxdata[0].vec()

If you do not have yet a pre-existing array into which you want to read
data, you can automatically create one, using the square brackets
syntax already known from retrieving the file header keywords. So, for
example, to get the x-Axis we create a second vector

>>> times=datafile["Time"]
(Note: you can also create an empty array with the same properties and
dimensions, but without reading data into the array, by preceding the
keyword with the word "empty", i.e. times=datafile["emptyTime"].)

In the square bracket notation python will actually set the name and
units of the data accordingly. 

So, let's have the time axis in microseconds, by using setUnit

>>> times.setUnit("\\mu","")
  Time(float, [2048]=2048, [0:2048]) -> [0.0,0.005,0.01,0.015,0.02,...]

We do the same now for the frequency axis, which we convert to MHz.

>>> frequencies=datafile["Frequency"].setUnit("M","")

We can calulcate the average spectum of the data set for one antenna,
by looping over all blocks. Here we do not use the square bracket
notation, since we want to read the data repeatedly into the same
memory location.

>>> fftdata=datafile["emptyFFT"]
>>> avspectrum=hArray(float,dimensions=fftdata,name="avgerage spectrum")
>>> for block in range(nBlocks):
...     fftdata.read(datafile.set("Block",block),"FFT").none()
...     fftdata[...].spectralpower(avspectrum[...])

(The .none() method is appended to suppress unwanted output in
generating the tutorial, when an operation returns an array or
vector.)


5.  Basic Plotting
------------------

In order to plot the data, we can use external packages. Two packages
are being provided here: matplotlib and mathgl. The former is
specifically designed for python and thus slightly easier to use
interactively. Since version 0.99 it is supposed to bea capable of 3D
plots (at the time of writing we use 0.98). Mathgl is faster and is
therefore used in our GUI programming. Eventually we will make it
available for interactive plotting as well.

5.1.  Mathgl
-------------

Here is a simple example on how to use mathgl code (here without a
widget)

from mathgl import *

width=800
height=600
size=1024
gr=mglGraph(mglGraphPS,width,height)
y=mglData(size)
y.Modify("cos(2*pi*x)")
x=mglData(size)
x.Modify("x*1024");
ymax=y.Maximal()
ymin=y.Minimal()
gr.Clf()
gr.SetRanges(0,0.5,ymin,ymax)
gr.Axis("xy")
gr.Title("Test Plot x")
gr.Label("x","x-Axis",1)
gr.Label("y","y-Axis",1)
gr.Plot(x,y);
gr.WriteEPS("test-y.eps","Test Plot")

5.2.  Matplotlib
------------------

Now, in principle, we need to import matplotlib

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
however, that should have been done already for you.

Depending on the system you may have to use

>>> plt.show()

and an empty plot window should pop up somehwere (in the background?)
!! On the Mac it seems to pop up automatically. 

(NB: At least on a Mac the window likes to stubbornly hide behind
other windows, so search your screen carefully if no window pops up.)

Depending on the system, the program could hang here and wait for
input. In this case you need to kill the window and re-issue the
command!!!

Now, we can use some of the plotting commands.

>>> plt.subplot(1,2,1)
>>> plt.title("Average Spectrum for Two Antennas")
>>> plt.semilogy(frequencies.vec(),avspectrum[0].vec())
>>> plt.semilogy(frequencies.vec(),avspectrum[1].vec())
>>> plt.ylabel(avspectrum.getKey("name")+" ["+avspectrum.getUnit()+"]")
>>> plt.xlabel(frequencies.getKey("name")+" ["+frequencies.getUnit()+"]")

To plot the time series of the entire data set, we first read in all
samples from all antennas

>>> datafile["block","blocksize"]=(0,maxblocksize)
>>> timeall=datafile["Time"]
>>> fxall=datafile["Fx"]

and then we plot it 

>>> plt.subplot(1,2,2)
>>> plt.title("Time Series of Antenna 0")
>>> plt.plot(timeall.vec(),fxall[0].vec())
>>> plt.ylabel("Electric Field [ADC counts]")
>>> plt.xlabel("Time [$\mu$s]")
   
  - ###################
  - #### Figure  1 ####
  - ###################

So, for a linear plot use .plot, for a loglog plot use .loglog and for
a log-linear plot use .semilogx or .semilogy ...

5.3.  Plotting Using the hArray Plotting Method
-------------------------------------------------

There is also a simpler way to make the kind of plots described above,
unsing the built-in plot method of array.

>>> avspectrum.par.xvalues=frequencies
>>> avspectrum.par.title="Average Spectrum"
>>> avspectrum[0].plot(logplot="y") 
   
  - ###################
  - #### Figure  2 ####
  - ###################

This creates a semilog-plot with appropriate lables and units (if they
were provided beforehand.)

You can either provide the parameters directly (precedence), or set
the plotting parameters as attributes to the .par class of the array,
e.g., "array.par.xvalues=x_vector; array.plot()"

If the array is in looping mode, multiple curves are plotted in one windows. Hence,

>>> avspectrum.par.logplot="y"
>>> avspectrum[...].plot(legend=datafile.antennas)
   
  - ###################
  - #### Figure  3 ####
  - ###################

will simply plot all spectra of all antennas (=highest array index) in
the array.

The availabe parameters are:

    Parameters:

    xvalues: an array with corresponding x values, if "None" numbers
    from 0 to length of the array are used

    xlabel: the x-axis label, if not specified, use the "name" keyword
    of the xvalues array - units will be added automatically

    ylabel: the y-axis label, if not specified, use the "name" keyword
    of the array - units will be added automatically

    xlim: tuple with minimum and maximum limits for the x-axis

    ylim: tuple with minimum and maximum limits for the y-axis

    title: a title for the plot

    clf: if True (default) clear the screen beforehand (use False to
    compose plots with multiple lines from different arrays.

    logplot: can be used to make loglog or semilog plots: 
            "x" ->semilog in x 
            "y" ->semilog in y
            "xy"->loglog plot


6.  CR Pipeline Modules
---------------------------

6.1.  Quality Checking of Time Series Data
----------------------------------------------

For an automatic pipeline it is essential to check whether the data is
of good quality, or whether one needs to flag particular
antennas. Here we demonstrate a simple, but effective way to do this.

The basic parameters to look at are the mean value of the time series
(indicating potential DC offsets), the root-mean-square (RMS)
deviation (related to the power received), and the number of peaks in
the data (indicating potential RFI problems).

For cosmic ray data, we expect spikes and peaks to be in the middle of
a trace, so we will just look at the first or/and last quarter of a
data set and set the block size accordingly.

>>> blocksize=min(filesize/4,maxblocksize)

We will then read this block of data into an apropriately sized data array.

>>> dataarray=datafile.set("blocksize",blocksize).set("block",3)["Voltage"]

The array now contains all the measured voltages of the selected
antennas in the file.

First we calculate the mean over all samples for each antennas (and
make use of the looping through the Ellipsis object).

>>> datamean = dataarray[...].mean()
    datamean => Vec(float,16)=[7.17281371124,-7.79051598837,-1.9765625,-0.283490794574,5.22622940891,...]

Similarly we get the rms (where we spare the algorithm from recalculating the
mean, by providing it as input - actually a list of means).

>>> datarms = dataarray[...].stddev(datamean)
    datarms => Vec(float,16)=[10.4218369439,10.3521070448,10.1878041442,11.9229119576,10.0156780471,...]

and finally we get the total number of peaks 5 sigma above the noise.

>>> datanpeaks = dataarray[...].countgreaterthanabs(datarms*5)
    datanpeaks => Vec(int,16)=[45,3,32,0,53,...]

To see whether we have more peaks than expected, we first calculate
the expected number of peaks for a Gaussian distribution and our
blocksize, as well as the error on that number.

>>> npeaksexpected=funcGaussian(5,1,0)*blocksize 
    npeaksexpected => 0.0490974252546
>>> npeakserror=sqrt(npeaksexpected) 
    npeakserror => 0.221579388154

So, that we can get a normalized quantity 

G = (Npeaks_detected - Npeaks_expected)/Npeaks_error

which should be of order unity if we have roughly a Gaussian
distribution. If it is much larger or less than unity we have more or
less peaks than expected and the data is clearly not Gaussian noise.

We do the calculation of G using our STL vectors (even though speed it no
of the essence here)

>>> dataNonGaussianity = Vector(float,nAntennas)
>>> dataNonGaussianity.sub(datanpeaks,npeaksexpected)
>>> dataNonGaussianity /= npeakserror

The next stept is to make a nice table of the results and check
whether these parameters are within the limits we have imposed (based
on empirical studies of the data). 

To ease the operation we combine all the data into one python array
(using the zip function - zip, as in zipper).

>>> dataproperties=zip(selectedAntennas,datamean,datarms,datanpeaks,dataNonGaussianity)

which is a rather nasty collection of numbers. So, we print a nice
table (restricting it to the first 5 antennas).

>>> for prop in dataproperties[0:5]: print "Antenna {0:3d}: mean={1: 6.2f}, rms={2:6.1f}, npeaks={3:5d}, nonGaussianity={4: 7.2f}".format(*prop)
  Antenna   0: mean=  7.17, rms=  10.4, npeaks=   45, nonGaussianity= 202.87
  Antenna   1: mean= -7.79, rms=  10.4, npeaks=    3, nonGaussianity=  13.32
  Antenna   2: mean= -1.98, rms=  10.2, npeaks=   32, nonGaussianity= 144.20
  Antenna   3: mean= -0.28, rms=  11.9, npeaks=    0, nonGaussianity=  -0.22
  Antenna   4: mean=  5.23, rms=  10.0, npeaks=   53, nonGaussianity= 238.97

Clearly this is a spiky dataset, with only one antenna not being
affected by too many peaks (which is in fact not the case for the
first block of that dataset).

To check automatically whether all parameters are in the allowed
range, we can use a little python helper function, using a python
"dict" as database for allowed parameters.

>>> qualitycriteria={"mean":(-15,15),"rms":(5,15),"nonGaussianity":(-3,3)}
>>> CheckParameterConformance(dataproperties[0],{"mean":1,"rms":2,"nonGaussianity":4},qualitycriteria)
  ['nonGaussianity']

The first paramter is just the list of numbers of the mean, rms,
etc. of one antenna we created above. The second parameter is a dict,
describing which parameter to find at which position in the input
list, and the third parameter is yet another dict specifying for each
parameter the range of allowed upper and lower values. The result is a
list of parameter names, where the antennas failed the test. The list
is empty if the antenna passed it.

Finally, we do not want to do this manually all the time. So, a little
python function is available, that does the quality checking for you
and returns a list with failed antennas and their properties.

>>> badantennalist=CRQualityCheck(qualitycriteria,datafile,dataarray,verbose=False) 

    badantennalist[0] => [15, 0, (0.46990067829457366, 214.1564187430852, 463, 2089.3229574834572), ['rms', 'nonGaussianity']]

(first the antenna number, then the block, then a list with the mean,
rms, npeaks, and nonGaussianity, and finally the failed fields)

Note, that this function can be called with "file=None". In this case
the data provided in the datararray will be used.

6.2.  Fourier Transforms (FFT) & Cross Correlation
-------------------------------------------------

We can make a FFT of a float vector. This function will only return
the non-redundant part of the FFT (i.e., just one half).  Again we
need to provide a properly sized output vector (input length/2+1). We
also have to specify as a second parameter in which NyquistZone the
data was take. 

Nyquist sampling means that one needs, for example, 200 MHz sampling
rate to digitize a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The first Nyquist zone is
then 0-100 MHz, and the second is 100-200 MHz.

So, let's do the transform:

>>> fftdata=hArray(complex,[nofSelectedAntennas,fftlength],name="FFT(E)")
>>> fxdata[...].fft(fftdata[...],1)

    fftdata => FFT(E)(complex, [16, 1025]=16400, [0:16400]) -> [(14776+0j),(-78.0619954633+23.5840915053j),(49.6800536667+19.8582762045j),(-69.6240335619+15.9113124235j),(2.28131321087-46.0593431603j),...]

Here we have used the fft method of the float array, which is just a
call to the stand-alone function hFFT defined in hftools.cc.

We can convert the data back into the time domain by using the inverse
Fourier transform.

>>> fxinvdata=hArray(float,dimensions=fxdata,name="E-Field'").setUnit("","Counts")
>>> fftdata[...].invfft(fxinvdata[...],1)

To get the spectral power from the FFTed vector, we have to square the
complex data and convert it to floats. This can be done using the
complex function "norm" (unusual name, but used in c++).

>>> spectrum=hArray(float,dimensions=fftdata,name="E-field Spectrum")
>>> fftdata[...].norm(spectrum)

Finally, we want to see, if we can do some cross correlation, which
mathematically is directly related to the Fourier transform.

We will do this with a data set from a solar burst (taken with LOPES
in 2003), since that is dominated by a single point source and hence
gives a nice and clear cross correlation.

>>> sun=crfile(filename_sun)
  Opening LOPES File=/Users/falcke/LOFAR/usg/data/lopes/example.event
  [DataReader::summary]
   -- blocksize ............ = 65536
   -- FFT length ........... = 32769
   -- file streams connected?  0
   -- shape(adc2voltage) ... = [65536, 8]
   -- shape(fft2calfft) .... = [32769, 8]
   -- nof. antennas ........ = 8
   -- nof. selected antennas = 8
   -- nof. selected channels = 32769
   -- shape(fx) ............ = [65536, 8]
   -- shape(voltage) ....... = [65536, 8]
   -- shape(fft) ........... = [32769, 8]
   -- shape(calfft) ........ = [32769, 8]

Now we read in the raw time series data as well as the Frequencies and
Time value arrays.

>>> sun_time=sun["Time"].setUnit("\\mu","s")
>>> sun_frequencies=sun["Frequency"]
>>> sun_efield=sun["Fx"].setPar("xvalues",sun_time)

As a next step we create an empty vector to hold the Fourierspectrum
of the data

>>> sun_fft=sun["emptyFFT"].setPar("xvalues",sun_frequencies)

and then make the Fourier transform (noting that the data is in the
second Nyquist domain)

>>> sun_efield[...].fft(sun_fft[...],2)

We will now try to make a crosscorrelation of the data. Let's start by
making a complex scratch vector to hold an intermediated data product
which is a copy of the fft vector.

>>> crosscorr_cmplx=hArray(copy=sun_fft)

We then multiply the FFTs of all antennas with the complex conjugate
of a reference antenna (here antenna 0) and store that in the vector
crosscorr_cmplx, which is done by the following method.

>>> crosscorr_cmplx[...].crosscorrelatecomplex(sun_fft[0])

This vector will then actually hold the FFT of the cross correlation
of the antenna time series. Hence, what we now need to do is to FFT
back into the time domain and store it in a vector crosscorr.

>>> sun_timelags=sun["TimeLag"].setUnit("\\mu","")
>>> crosscorr=hArray(float,dimensions=sun_efield,name="Cross Correlation",xvalues=sun_timelags) 
>>> crosscorr_cmplx[...].invfft(crosscorr[...],2)

We can now plot this and use as the x-axis vector the Time Lags
conveniently provided by our cr file object.

>>> crosscorr.par.xlim=(-1,1)
>>> crosscorr[1].plot()
   
  - ###################
  - #### Figure  4 ####
  - ###################

Note, plotting crosscorr[0].plot() will give the autocorrelation of
the first antenna (which we used as reference antenna in this example).

6.3.  Coordinates
---------------

We also have access to a few functions dealing with astronomical
coordinates. Assume, we have a source at an Azmiut/Elevation position
of (178 Degree,28 Degree) and we want to convert that into Cartesian
coordinates (which, for example, is required by our beamformer).

We first turn this into std vector and create a vector that is
supposed to hold the Cartesian coordinates. Note that the AzEL vector
is actually AzElRadius, where we need to set the radius to unity.

>>> azel=hArray([178.,28,1],dimensions=[1,3])
>>> cartesian=azel.new()

We then do the conversion, using

>>> hCoordinateConvert(azel[...],CoordinateTypes.AzElRadius,cartesian[...],CoordinateTypes.Cartesian,True)

yielding the following output vector:

    cartesian => hArray(float, [1, 3]=3, [0:3]) -> [0.0308144266055,-0.882409725042,0.469471562786]


6.4.  Coordinates
---------------

For doing actual beamforming we need to know the antenna
positions. For this we will use the method getCalData:

>>> antenna_positions=sun.getCalData("Position")
    antenna_positions => hArray(float, [8, 3]=24, [0:24]) -> [-84.5346026,36.1095688,0.0,-52.6146025237,54.4735691204,...]

As a next step we need to put the antenna coordinates on a reference
frame that is relative to the phase center. Here we will choose the
location of the first antenna as our phase center (that makes life a
little easier for checking) and we simply subtract the reference
position from the antenna locations so that our phase center lies at
0,0,0.

>>> phase_center=hArray(antenna_positions[0].vec())
>>> antenna_positions -= phase_center

Now we read in instrumental delays for each antenna in a similar way
and store it for later use.

>>> cal_delays=sun.getCalData("Delay")
    cal_delays => hArray(float, [8]=8, [0:8]) -> [0.0,2.3875e-09,-1.3625e-09,-2.8925e-09,-2.4375e-08,...]

We now convert the Azimuth-Elevation position into a vector in
Cartesian coordinates, which is what is used by the beamformer.

>>> hCoordinateConvert(azel,CoordinateTypes.AzElRadius,cartesian,CoordinateTypes.Cartesian,True)

Then calculate geometric delays and add the instrumental delays.

>>> delays=hArray(float,dimensions=cal_delays)
>>> hGeometricDelays(antenna_positions,cartesian,delays,True)

To get the total delay we add the geometric and the calibration delays.

>>> delays += cal_delays

The delays can be converted to phases of coplex weights (to be applied
in the Fourier domain).

>>> phases=hArray(float,dimensions=sun_fft,name="Phases",xvalues=sun_frequencies)
>>> hGeometricPhases(sun_frequencies,antenna_positions,cartesian,phases,True)

Similarly, the corresponding complex weights are calculated.

>>> weights=hArray(complex,dimensions=sun_fft,name="Complex Weights")
>>> hGeometricWeights(sun_frequencies,antenna_positions,cartesian,weights,True)

To shift the time series data (or rather the FFTed time series data)
we multiply the fft data with the complex weights from above.

>>> sun_calfft_shifted=hArray(copy=sun_fft)
>>> sun_calfft_shifted *= weights

We can check whether the shifts were doing what we expected it to do
by making another crosscorrelation (using the shifted FFT data as
starting point).

>>> crosscorr_cmplx_shifted=hArray(copy=sun_calfft_shifted)
>>> crosscorr_cmplx_shifted[...].crosscorrelatecomplex(sun_calfft_shifted[0])
>>> crosscorr_shifted=hArray(float,dimensions=sun_efield,name="Cross Correlation",xvalues=sun_timelags)
>>> crosscorr_cmplx_shifted[...].invfft(crosscorr_shifted[...],2)
>>> crosscorr_shifted[...].plot(xlim=(-0.25,0.25),legend=sun.antennaIDs)
   
  - ###################
  - #### Figure  5 ####
  - ###################

And indeed now most of the antennas show a lag peaking around 0, with
the exception of two antennas (whick likely experienced an additional
two-sample shift).

So, let's transform back into time and see the final, shifted time
series.

>>> sun_efield_shifted = sun["emptyFx"].setPar("xvalues",sun_time)
>>> sun_calfft_shifted[...].invfft(sun_efield_shifted[...],2)
>>> sun_efield_shifted[0:3,...].plot(xlim=(-2,0),ylim=(-1500,1500),legend=sun.antennaIDs[0:3])
   
  - ###################
  - #### Figure  6 ####
  - ###################

Obviously the three time series are now tracing each other nicely,
indicating that the delays were about right. To now "form a beam" we
just need to add all time series data (or their FFTs),

>>> sun_calfft_shifted_added=hArray(sun_calfft_shifted[0].vec())
>>> sun_calfft_shifted_added.add(sun_calfft_shifted[1:,...])

normalize by the number of antennas (which for some reason we don't
need to do after all), 
sun_calfft_shifted_added /= sun.nofSelectedAntennas

and then FFT back into the time domain:

>>> sun_efield_shifted_added=hArray(float,dimensions=sun_time,name="beamformed E-field",xvalues=sun_time)
>>> sun_calfft_shifted_added.invfft(sun_efield_shifted_added,2)

>>> sun_efield[0].plot()
>>> sun_efield_shifted_added.plot(xlim=(-2,0),clf=False,legend=["Reference Antenna","Beam"])
   
  - ###################
  - #### Figure  7 ####
  - ###################

In the plot one can see how the green line (beamformed) traces the
data in antenna one (which was our reference antenna). Of course, I
still do not understand why we do not need to normalize the beamformed
data by the number of antennas ...
