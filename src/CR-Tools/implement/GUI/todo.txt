- implement a getParameter/ResultsObjects function in the Data object, use this to create a parameter browser and editor for functions ..

- add Gauss fit and selecting



hffuncs.cc:

- Treatment of vector selectors in object functions is not yet properly implemented!

- printvec_txt und direction_txt don't work correctly (only first letter is shown for fist vector elements).

- the new virtual functions destroy and initialize are not called by the class constructor and destructor, just the generic ones - this is annoying

- make objects readonly, so that important pointers cannot be overwritten! 

- hfget.hpp: Note that the ID method needs a bit more work (e.g. to give the ID of the current object with input "")

- provide methods for the functions to set/ default values and names of
  parameters ...

- property object??

- make sure that objects stroed with pystore and referred to by PyFunc don't
  crash the system if deleted under python

- in aipscol2stlvec access matric elements directly (withou .column) and
  return an empty vector incase of error

- clearModification does not work with dataReader network 

- potential memory leaks when putting pointers of objects into a Data object
  (and overwriting an old one without destroying it!), e.g. in hfPlotWindow

- currently a poiner to a pyfunction has to be assigned to a pyobject first,
  which is then passed to .putPy() - here one has to worry about uniqueness
  and what happens if that object is being overwritten (but pointer emains in
  memory). Use "ward" mechanism in boost?

- Replace the ID by some other unique identifier. The problem is that the ID
  is only unique within one data network. However, it is perfectly reasonable
  to link two data networks, which would then have two superiors and duplicate IDs!


- Introduce a dictionary for object names, which assign each name a unique
  interger number. That should make searching faster for at least nearby
  parameters if the unique number is stored with the parameters.

- The modification flag may need to be passed with getParameter (to be
  used with setModification()). For example, if (e.g. after creation
  of the network) an object is not up-to-date getParameter will update
  it, which will cause an update throughout higher up the net and
  hence cause multiple updates including the object that called
  getParameter.

- Somehow get the data.beingmodified flag/check to work (the problem
  is that DOSILENT always only affects the first object) and the
  others can generate false (?) alarms. getParameter seems to be a
  culprit.
 
- Let the c++ functions als return DataObjects (or pointers), just like python

- Change the search algorithm so that it goes stepwise through the net, one level after the next, returning all object links of the net level (violates locality, but the update worm has done that already ....)

- Maybe introduce a "link updated", i.e. a message that tells
  dependent objects that the network structure has changed. This could
  also be used for optimization. i.e. the search for parameters is
  only done once (when links changed) and then the parameters are
  directly linked internally.

- Think about the update worm: How does one make this more efficient
if multiple results are being created -> perhaps by blocking teh
Results object until all operations are performed!

  BUGS:

- hfgui.py - hfsetBlock : touch needs to be done twice - which is a bit of a waste ...

- the conversion between types doesn not work correctly!! It uses
  reinterpret_cast somewhere, instead of a real cast.

- a link should not be created two times when calling >> twice....

- if an object is deleted and there is a python reference, that python
  object does not know about it and python crashes when calling the
  pyhton reference. This can be avoided with a special reference
  handling in BoostPython 

- isolated objects should be automatically deleted when the last link
  to them is linked. That does not seem to happen.

- d.delObject() does not work properly (the last elements in the list are not
  deleted if several have been deleted at once) - use DataList.delObject() to
  test. (this is probably fixed now ...)

- performance issues when plotting - check how the network works ...
