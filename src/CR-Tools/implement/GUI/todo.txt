hffuncs.cc:

- Treatment of vector selectors in object functions is not yet properly implemented!

- printvec_txt und direction_txt don't work correctly (only first letter is shown for fist vector elements).

- the new virtual functions destroy and initialize are not called by the class constructor and destructor, just the generic ones - this is annoying

- make objects readonly, so that important pointers cannot be overwritten! 

- hfget.hpp: Note that the ID method needs a bit more work (e.g. to give the ID of the current object with input "")

- property object??
