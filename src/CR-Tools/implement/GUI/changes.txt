$$2009-07-11-HF:

hfget.cc:
Added visit_markers. These are dropped during network searches in each
visited object. Hence, a cicular network won't lead to an infinite
loop.

hffuncs.cc, GUI:
Added subtraction, addition, multiplication (div and pow) functions. They look
for an object named "Reference" and subtract that vector (or a single
number) from an object data vector.

hfcrfuncs.cc: 

The GUI PipelineLauncher automatically determines the y-Axis data of
the first antenna as the reference vector for subtraction, addition,
multiplication (div and pow) functions. So, if you select "sub" in the
"f(y)" part of the GUI, you will get the difference between the first
antenna and all other ones. (Naturally the ref antenna will then
become zero). Later the refence should be set through the GUI. You can
always set the Reference antenna manually, e.g, by

~d["Reference"]; d["Antenna=3:y:Data"] >> "Reference" >> d["DataPipeline"] 

(Note, there is still a bug which can make this crash once in a while
....) 

It would be fairly easy to add a cross-correlation between two
antennas in the same way. Modify the section after "//$ITERATE MFUNC
sub,mul,add,div,pow" in hffuncs_awk.cc accordingly, by adding a
cross-correlation function (see hf_mul as an example).
