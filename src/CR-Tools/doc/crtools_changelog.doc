Hey folks,

I think it is time for sending around a short note on what I going on right now
and has been happening within the last few days. (btw., if I am missing somebody
on this list, please forward this mail and let me know to be more complete next
time).

1) With more and more activities dedicated towards preparing for LOFAR20,
considerable amount of work has been put in to providing access to the produced
data sets. The relevant code is delivered with the Data Access Library (DAL),
until recently developed and written by Joseph Masters (UvA); after signing up
for another position, Joe no longer is available to drive the bulk of the DAL
development and take care of bigger bug fixes. In order to maintain a minimum
level of support (fixes, required enhancements), for the time being I have taken
over the responsibility to keep the DAL around and suited to our needs. With the
increased usage of the library a number of bugs surfaced recently, which as of
this week should be fixed. (http://usg.lofar.org/doxygen/dal_changelog.html)

2) The changes in the DAL triggered the surfacing of an error in the build of
the CR-Tools, which resulted in the build of at least one executable to build.
This now has been resolved and tested on the standard test platforms.

3) The Qt-based graphical user interface Heino has been working on is now part
of the standard build of the CR-Tools; after tracking down two errors in the
CMake configuration scripts the shared library is created, installed and thereby
(at least I hope) ready for use. Concerning the functionality and usage all
questions should be directed towards Heino, since I am not involved in the
writing of the code itself (just ensuring development can be carried out within
the framework as used for the rest of the software).

4) It was pointed out, that we should have a possibility to track "stable
releases" of our software; with the soon to be increasing number of users -
which are not necessarily developers - we need a way to provide people with a
version of the CR-Tools, which properly builds and does not contain major bugs
known at that point. While it may require a certain minimal amount of logistics
to actually determine when to give a version these blessings and then also
imprint this into the code repository, for the time being I have set up a
"Stable source code versions" <a href="http://usg.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=software:packages:cr-tools:stable_source_code_versions">page on the Wiki</a> which should provide you with the essential information about versions consider stable for working with. Note: if you are actively developing code, then changes of course should always be worked into the latest version!

Next in line:

1) Finished recursive retrieval of the metadata attached to the TBB time-series
data sets to present them to the header record as part of the DataReader class
(and its derivatives).

2) Add simple mechanism to write missing metadata to the TBB time-series data
sets; currently information such as antennas positions, etc. are not shipped
with the data sets, since the connection to the metadata database is not in
place yet.

3) If nothing major comes up, clean up the contents of the Imaging module and
solve the two known issues which keep a first version of the Imager becoming
operational.
