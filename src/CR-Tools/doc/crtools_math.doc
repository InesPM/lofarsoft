  \brief Math module for the CR-pipeline
  
  <h3>Synopsis</h3>

  Even though we make usage of the extensive functionality of the CASA math
  modules, there sometimes are operations missing which will be required 
  over and over again. The Math module of the CR-Pipeline is a collection of
  such additional functions.
