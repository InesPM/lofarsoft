\section crtools_changes_build Build issues

- No build from scratch possible on Ray; however this appears not to be an issue with the CR-Tools code itself, but rather with the dependency
on the Boost library. Even after removing the very specific additional search path for external components to the installation in /opt/aips++
the build still fails due to picking up the Boost installation in /usr instead $LOFARSOFT/release.

<hr>

\section crtools_changes_classes Issues with library classes

- CR::SpatialCoordinate
  - test \e toWorld and \e toPixel methods for all coordinate configurations

- CR::SkymapCoordinates
  - replace internal CR::TimeFreq object with CR::TimeFreqSkymap
  - use CR::SpatialCoordinate instead of individual coordinate objects

- DAL::LOFAR_StationGroup
  - Collect start-times of the dumps from the individual dipoles and thereof compute a relative shift between the data channels.

<hr>

\section crtools_changes_tools Issues with application programs

- skymapper
  - complete Boost command-line interface
