\section crtools_changes_build Build issues

- No build from scratch possible on Ray; however this appears not to be an issue with the CR-Tools code itself, but rather with the dependency
on the Boost library. Even after removing the very specific additional search path for external components to the installation in /opt/aips++
the build still fails due to picking up the Boost installation in /usr instead $LOFARSOFT/release.

- Opening a file with the CR::LOFAR_TBB class doesn't work. A line like:
  \verbatim
  hdf5In = new LOFAR_TBB(files(fnum),524288);
  \endverbatim
  stop either without error message, or with something like:
  \verbatim
  *** glibc detected *** double free or corruption: 0x0876f688 ***
  \endverbatim
  I have also seen it throw a segfault, but that was with a potentially bogous
  version of the DAL. (I.e. the posibility that the includes and libraries from
  two different boost version were used.)

- hfget library
  - Import of the symbols from the generated library fails:
  \verbatim
  Python 2.4.4 (#2, Apr 15 2008, 23:43:20) 
  [GCC 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> from libhfget import *
  Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  ImportError: ./libhfget.so: invalid ELF header
  >>> 
  \endverbatim

\section crtools_changes_classes Issues with library classes

- CR::SpatialCoordinate
  - test \e toWorld and \e toPixel methods for all coordinate configurations

- CR::SkymapCoordinates
  - replace internal CR::TimeFreq object with CR::TimeFreqSkymap
  - use CR::SpatialCoordinate instead of individual coordinate objects

- CR::LOFAR_TBB
  - add an \e attachFile method to the class, such that we can have a default
  constructor without directly opening the data file

<hr>

\section crtools_changes_tools Issues with application programs

- skymapper
  - complete the command-line interface using the Boost \e program_options library
