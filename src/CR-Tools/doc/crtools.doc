  This documentation contains the description of the C/C++ components of the
  software used for data inspection and reduction with the
  <a href="http://www.astro.ru.nl/lopes">LOPES</a> and LOFAR/CR experiments.

  The sub-directories and their contribution to the CR-Tools is as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>apps</b> -- Source code for application programs which can be run
        from the command line or through a secondary control layer. 
    <li><b>data</b> -- Collection of data used for test programs.
    <li><b>docs</b>
    <li><b>implement</b> -- Source code, mainly C++ classes, which are compiled
        into a library, based on which application programs are build.
    <li><b>private</b> -- Source code from private projects of the individual
        users; this is not part of the default build, but optionally can be
	enabled.
  </ul>
