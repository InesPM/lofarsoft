Algorithm overview: 
.br
This code (pipeline) uses several classes\&. Each classes has a particular role for processing dynamic spectrum data (ICD6)\&. The role of this code is to convert a dynamic spectrum file in another lighter dynamic spectrum file\&. In fact, after a first processing, we obtain a first dynamic spectrum, but this dynamic spectrum is to massive to be visualized or the user needs only a smaller part of this spectrum\&. It is useless and unoptimized to reprocess all the ICD3 data ! Because ICD3 data must be very massive (more than 100 To) and time reprocessing could be very long (more than several day) ! So we introduce this tool to avoid reprocessing !
.PP

.br
Main code etablishes principal parameters of the observation (number of SAP, Beam and Stokes parameters\&. Thanks to robustess nomenclature of ICD3 format, with these parameter we are able to know which file we have to process for a given SAP, Beam and Stokes parameter) After existency tests and principal parameters determination, the main code will loop of the SAPs that it has to process:
.PP
First the code wil stock Root group metadata\&. Root Metadata are red by a function named readRoot and contained in the class \fBReader_Root_Dyn2Dyn_Part\&.h\fP, the Root group is generated and Root's matadata are stocked, then written by a function named writeRootMetadata and contained in the class \fBStock_Write_Root_Dyn2Dyn_Metadata_Part\&.h\fP
.PP
Secondly, the main code will loop on Beam, and generate dynamic spectrum group and its metadata\&. The dynamic spectrum's metadata are red by a function named readDynspec and contained in the class \fBReader_Dyn2Dyn_Part\&.h\fP, after, metadata are stocked, then written by a function named writeDynspecMetadata contained in \fBStock_Write_Dyn2Dyn_Metadata_Part\&.h\fP
.PP
Finaly, data are processed\&. Because LOFAR data are very voluminous, we have to develop a strategy for: 
.br
 - To avoid swaping 
.br
 - To have enough memory for loading data 
.br
 - etc \&.\&.\&. We decide to use a frozen quantity of RAM for a processing\&. This quantity is chosen by the user and corresponds to a number of time bins that we can process for this RAM\&. So, the code will loop of the number of Time series we need to process all the selected data\&. Rebinning is done inside these blocks\&. To conclude, data processing is done time blocks by time blocks, and data generation is done by the function writeDynspecData which is included in the class \fBStock_Write_Dyn2Dyn_Data_Part\&.h\fP Only selected data (time-frequency selection) are processed and/or rebinned !!
