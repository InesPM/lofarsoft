##  Initial cache settings for CMake project "psrfits_utils"
##
##  Instead of passing all of the required cache variables, which are derived
##  from system inspection, as command line options (using the "-D" flag) we
##  pass along a configured include file. This not only avoids long and hard to
##  read string on the comand line but also aids in later debugging, as the 
##  configuration settings can be read from the processed version of this file.
