DescDetail: << 
  MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL's C API. It is built around STL 
  principles, to make dealing with the database as easy as dealing with an
  STL container. MySQL++ relieves the programmer of dealing with cumbersome C
  data structures, generation of repetitive SQL statements, and manual
  creation of C++ data structures to mirror the database schema.
